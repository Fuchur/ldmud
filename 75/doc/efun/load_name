SYNOPSIS
	string load_name()
	string load_name(object obj)

DESCRIPTION
        If <obj> is a clone, return the load_name() of <obj>'s blueprint.
        If <obj> is a blueprint, return the filename from which the
        blueprint was compiled.
        
        For virtual objects this efun of course returns the virtual filename.
        If <obj> is omitted, the name for the current object is returned.

        In contrast to the object_name(), the load name can not be changed
        by with rename_object(). However, if an object uses replace_program()
        the load name no longer reflects the actual behaviour of an object.

        The returned name starts with a '/', unless the driver is running
        in COMPAT mode.

EXAMPLE
	object o;
	o = clone_object("/std/thing");
	write(load_name(o));  --> writes "/std/thing" in !compat mode
	                             and "std/thing"  in compat mode

HISTORY
	Introduced in LDMud 3.2.6.
