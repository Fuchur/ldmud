SYNOPSIS
        int net_connect(string host, int port)

DESCRIPTION
        Open a non-blocking TCP network connection to <host> and
        <port>.  On success, the connection is bound to the current
        object and the lfun logon() is called in the object.

        If the connection can't be established immediately, the efun
        returns 'success' and the driver will check in the background
        for the progress of the connection. When it is established,
        logon() will be called in the object. If the connection fails,
        logon(-1) will be called in the object.

        The efun raises a privilege violation ("net_connect", host, port).

        Return 0 on success, and a Unix ERRNO on failure.
