SYNOPSIS
        int get_eval_time()

DESCRIPTION
        Returns the remaining time for the current execution (the current
        command) before an 'evaluation too long' error would occur.

        It starts at a driver-given high value (__MAX_EVAL_TIME__) and
        is reduced every two seconds.

	Only available if the driver was compiled with MAX_TIME.

HISTORY
	Introduced in LDMud 3.2.6.
