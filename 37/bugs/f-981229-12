the efun

  mixed copy(mixed data, bool all = false)
  
creates and returns a value copy of data for strings, mappings and arrays,
and returns data for everything else.

mappings and arrays are value copys (like data+({})), and if all is true,
all containing mappings and arrays are copied as well.

strings are made shared if not already so.
