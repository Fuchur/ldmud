Short: Warning 'comparison always zero'

When compiling under Linux, the above mentioned warnings occur, but
only if compiling with optimization and if svalue.type and svalue.x
share the same longword in memory. Assigning one of the two fields
to a local variable fixes the problem.

I suspect a compiler error and noted it in C_COMPILER_BUGS.
