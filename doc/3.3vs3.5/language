Listed herein are language incompatibilites between 3.3 and 3.5,
that you should pay attention to when updating.

- sefun prefix:
  The 3.5 driver allows to explicitly call simul-efuns using a 'sefun::'
  prefix, e.g. sefun::fun(). If a program has inherited another
  program with the name "sefun" and explicitly called inherited
  lfuns with that syntax, this won't work anymore, because the
  driver now tries to find a simul-efun with that name.
  This also applies to symbol_function and closure literals (#'sefun::fun).
