SYNOPSIS
        #include <debug_info.h>

        mixed debug_info(int flag)
        mixed debug_info(int flag, mixed arg)
        mixed debug_info(int flag, mixed arg2, mixed arg3)

DESCRIPTION
        Gather some driver internal debug information according
        to the setting of flag:

        DINFO_OBJECT (0): Information like heart_beat, enable_commands
            etc. of the specified object will be printed, and 0 returned.

        DINFO_MEMORY (1): Memory usage information like how many strings,
            variables, inherited files, object size etc. will be printed
            about the specified object, and 0 returned.

        DINFO_OBJLIST (2): Objects from the global object list are
            returned.  If the optional second arg is omitted, the first
            element (numbered 0) is returned. If the second arg is a
            number n, the n'th element of the object list returned. If the
            second arg is an object, it's successor in the object list is
            returned.

        DINFO_MALLOC (3): Equivalent to typing ``malloc'' at the command
            line. No second arg must be given. Returns 0.

        DINFO_STATUS (4): Collect the status information of the driver.
            The optional second arg can be 0, "tables", "swap", "malloc"
            or any other argument accepted by the actual driver.
            The result is a printable string with the status information,
            or 0 if an invalid argument was given.

        DINFO_DUMP (5): Dump the information specified by <arg2> into the
            filename specified by <arg3>. If <arg3> is omitted, a default
            file name is used. The function calls master->valid_write() to
            check that it can write the files. The file in question is
            always written anew.

            Result is 1 on success, or 0 if an error occured.

            <arg2> == "objects": dump information about all objects.
              Default filename is '/OBJ_DUMP', the valid_write() will read
              'objdump' for the function.
            <arg2> == "opcodes": dump usage information about the opcodes.
              Default filename is '/OPC_DUMP', the valid_write() will read
              'opcdump' for the function.

        DINFO_DATA (6): Return raw information about an aspect of
            the driver specified by <arg2>. The result of the function
            is an array with the information, or 0 for unsupported values
            of <arg2>.

            Allowed values for <arg2> are: DID_STATUS, DID_SWAP, DID_MALLOC.

HISTORY
        Since 3.2.7, DINFO_STATUS returns the status information instead
          of printing it.
        DINFO_DUMP introduced with 3.2.7.
        LDMud 3.2.8 added the data size of the object to the result of
          DINFO_MEMORY; the DINFO_DATA request; the DID_MEM_WASTED* stats.
        LDMud 3.3 replaced the string related DID_ST_ constants according to
        the new string implementation.
        LDMud 3.2.9 added DINFO_TRACE; the DID_MEM_CLIB* and DID_MEM_PERM*
          stats.
