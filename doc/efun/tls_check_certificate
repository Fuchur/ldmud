PRELIMINARY
SYNOPSIS
        mixed *tls_check_certificate()
        mixed *tls_check_certificate(object obj);

DESCRIPTION
        tls_check_certificate() checks the certificate of the secured
        connection bound to <obj> (default is the current object).  If
        <obj> is not interactive, or if TLS is not available, an error
        is thrown.

        If <obj> doesn't have a secure connection up and running, an
        error is thrown.

        Otherwise, the result is an array with these entries:

          int [0]      : Result code of SSL_get_verify_result (see man 1 verify
                         subsection DIAGNOSTICS for possible values)
          string [1]   : Subject
          int    [2..9]: Not used yet.
          string [10]  : SHA-1 Fingerprint
          string [11]  : Not used yet (reserved for MD5 Fingerprint)

BUGS
        Not supported when using GnuTLS.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.3.672/3.2.11.
        LDMud 3.3.711/3.2.12 modified the behaviour to return the
        low-level API result value, and to throw an error if the connection
        is not secure.
