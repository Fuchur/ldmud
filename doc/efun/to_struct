SYNOPSIS
        mixed to_struct(mixed * data)
        mixed to_struct(mixed * data, struct template)
        mixed to_struct(struct)

DESCRIPTION
        The given array <data> is returned as a struct. If a
        <template> struct is given, the returned struct is of the same
        type; without a template, an anonymous struct is returned.
        Structs are returned unchanged.

        Since the returned struct can't be known at compile time, the
        efun is declared to return 'mixed'.
