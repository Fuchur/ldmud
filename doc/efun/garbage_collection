SYNOPSIS
        void garbage_collection ()
        void garbage_collection (string filename)
        void garbage_collection (string filename, int flag)

DESCRIPTION
        Tell the parser to initiate a garbage collection after the
        current execution ended.

        With the <filename> argument a log file for the GC output
        different from the default log file can be specified.

        If <flag> is not given or 0, the output from the next
        and only the next GC will go into the log file. If the file
        already exists, the new output will be appended.

        If <flag> is 1, the <filename> will be used as the new
        default log file for all following GCs. If the file already
        exists, it will be overwritten from the start.

EXAMPLES
        garbage_collection()
         [ GC occurs -> logs into default file ]

        garbage_collection("/GCLOG")
         [ GC occurs -> logs into "/GCLOG" ]

        garbage_collection("/GCLOG", 1)
         [ GC occurs -> logs into "/GCLOG", sets default log to "/GCLOG" ]

        garbage_collection("/GCLOG")
        garbage_collection("/GCLOG2")
         [ GC occurs -> logs into "/GCLOG" ]

        garbage_collection("/GCLOG", 1)
        garbage_collection("/GCLOG2")
         [ GC occurs -> logs into "/GCLOG2", sets default log to "/GCLOG" ]

HISTORY
