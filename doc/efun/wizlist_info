SYNOPSIS
        #include <wizlist.h>

        mixed *wizlist_info()

DESCRIPTION
        Returns an array with the interesting entries of the wizlist.
        Needs to be privileged by the master object.

        The result is an array with one entry for every wizard (uid).
        Every entry is an array itself:

          string w[WL_NAME]        = Name of the wizard.
          int    w[WL_COMMANDS]    = Number of commands execute by objects
                                     of this wizard.
          int    w[WL_EVAL_COST]   = Total sum of eval_costs.
          int    w[WL_HEART_BEATS] = Total count of heart_beats.
          int    w[WL_CALL_OUT]    = Reserved for call_out() (unused yet).
          int    w[WL_ARRAY_TOTAL] = Total size of arrays in elements.
          int    w[WL_MAPPING_TOTAL] = Total size of mappings in elements.
          mixed  w[WL_EXTRA]       = Extra wizlist-info if set.
