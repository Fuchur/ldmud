SYNOPSIS
        int get_eval_number()

DESCRIPTION
        get_eval_number() returns the current evaluation number. The number
        is incremented for each top-level call. Top-level calls are initiated
        by the driver, usually in reaction to an external event:
          - commands (added by add_action)
          - heart_beat, reset, clean_up
          - calls from call_out or input_to
          - master applies triggered by external events
          - calls of driver hooks in reaction to external events
          - send_erq callbacks
          - logon in interactives

        The efun can be used to detect cases where the same code is executed
        twice in the same top level evaluation (heart_beat), and also for
        time stamps for ordering some events.

        Please note that the counter may overflow, especially on 32 bit
        systems. As a result, it can also be negative.
