NAME
    predefined - predefined #defines by the parser

DESCRIPTION
    Several preprocessor macros are pre#defined by the parser,
    to provide information about parser version, compile time
    options and parser invocation options:

      LPC3            : always defined.
      __EUIDS__       : always (for compatibility).
      COMPAT_FLAG     : defined if the driver runs in compat mode.
      __COMPAT_MODE__ : ditto
      __STRICT_EUIDS__: defined if strict euid usage is enforced.

      __MASTER_OBJECT__ : the name of the master object (in compat mode
                          without leading '/').
      __FILE__          : the name of the compiled file (in compat mode
                          without leading '/').
      __LINE__          : the actual line number.
      __DIR__           : the directory path of the compiled file (in
                          compat mode without leading '/').
      __PATH__(n)       : the <n> leading directory path elements of the
                          compiled file (in compat mode without leading '/').
      __VERSION__       : the version string of the driver.

      __DOMAIN_NAME__    : the domain the host is part of.
      __HOST_IP_NUMBER__ : the hosts IP number (as a string).
      __HOST_NAME__      : the full hostname.
      __MAX_RECURSION__  : the max count of nested function calls
                           (this is config.h:MAX_USER_TRACE).
      __MAX_EVAL_COST__  : the max evaluation cost.
      __EFUN_DEFINED__(name) : if the efun 'name' exists, this
                               macro evaluates to " 1 ", else to " 0 ".

    If the ERQ is supported, the following macros are defined:

      __ERQ_MAX_SEND__  : the max size of the send buffer
      __ERQ_MAX_REPLY__ : the max size of the reply buffer

    The following macros are defined if their associated package
    has been compiled into the driver:
      
      __IPV6__ :      support for IP v 6
      __LPC_NOSAVE__: support for the 'nosave' keyword


HISTORY
    3.2.1 added __DOMAIN_NAME__, __HOST_IP_NUMBER__, __HOST_NAME__,
        __MAX_RECURSION__, __EFUN_DEFINED__().
    3.2.5 added __COMPAT_MODE__, __NATIVE_MODE__, __EUIDS__,
        __ERQ_MAX_SEND__ and __ERQ_MAX_REPLY__.
    3.2.6 added __MAX_EVAL_COST__.
    3.2.7 added __STRICT_EUIDS__ and made __EUIDS__ standard.
    3.2.8 added __IPV6__, __LPC_NOSAVE__, __DIR__, __PATH__().
