NAME
        dumpallobj

DESCRIPTION
        Write a list of all loaded or cloned objects into the file
        OBJ_DUMP in the root directory of the mudlib.

        Warning: this file can be very large, and if the driver is low
        on memory there is a certain crash probability.

        If the O_IS_WIZARD flag is used in the mudlib (i.e. if
        set_is_wizard() was called), this command is allowed only for
        users that have this flag set.

        For every object, a line is written into the file with the
        following information in the given order:
          - object name
          - size in memory, shared data counted only once
          - size in memory if data wouldn't be shared
          - number of references
          - 'HB' if the object has a heartbeat, nothing if not.
          - the name of the environment, or '--' if the object has no
            environment
          - in parentheses the number of execution ticks spent in this
            object
          - the swap status:
             nothing if not swapped,
             'PROG SWAPPED' if only the program is swapped
             'VAR SWAPPED' if only the variabes are swapped
             'SWAPPED' if both program and variables are swapped
