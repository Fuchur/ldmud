        /* This function should be called, after the network connection
         * was given to this object via exec().
         */
        void setup_player()
        {
            /* In a screen-oriented editor, most of the printable
             * characters (excluding answers to editor prompts
             * 'j', 'n' and 'q') can be combined into strings.
             */
            configure_interactive(this_object(),
                IC_COMBINE_CHARSET_AS_STRING,
                "abcdefghijklmoprstuvwxz0123456789"
                "ABCDEFGHIJKLMOPRSTUVWXZ");

            /* To disable any previous setting, just call: */
            configure_interactive(this_object(),
                IC_COMBINE_CHARSET_AS_STRING, "");
