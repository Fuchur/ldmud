Short: diagnostic() functionality

Add a diagnostic() function to simulate.c which acts like error(),
but does not abort the execution.

Use it for situations like

>     remove() {
>         destruct(this_object());
>         this_player()->set_active(0);
            --> Diagnostic "Call-other from destructed obj...prog...line"
>         return 1;
>     }
