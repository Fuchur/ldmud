SYNOPSIS
	int notify_fail(string str)
	int notify_fail(closure cl)

DESCRIPTION
	Store str as the error message given instead of the default
	message ``What ?''. The result is always 0.
	
	If a closure is given, it is executed to return the error
	message string, but not before all attempts to execute the
	commandline failed (read: not at the time of the call to
	notify_fail()).
	
	If notify_fail() is called more than once, only the last call
	will be used.
	
	The idea of this function is to give better error messages
	instead of simply 'What ?'.
	
	It is also better to use
		notify_fail(message); return 0;
	instead of
		write(message); return 1;
	
	Other objects will get the chance to evaluate the verb.

HISTORY
        Returntype changed in LDMud 3.2.6 from void to int.
