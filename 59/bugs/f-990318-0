Short: Better management of objects

look_for_objs_to_swap() suffers from the unstructured way objects
are kept: in a linear list. For large muds, scanning the list becomes
a time consuming event.

Objects should be kept in two sorted tables of lists: the first
table is sorted by .next_reset, the second by .time_since_ref. Every
table entry collects all objects within the given granularity
(RESET_GRANULARITY, min(time_to_swap, time_to_swap_vars)).

Reset table: after an object was reset, it can be removed from
the table until its RESET_STATE is cleared?
