This directory contains the necessary files to adapt certain mudlibs
to run under LDMud, or vice versa.

The general structure for a mud Foo is this:

  foo/           holds all files related to Foo
  foo/INFO.txt : information about Foo and its relation to LDMud
  foo/src/     : source files and patches if changes to LDMud are necessary.
  foo/lib/     : source files and patches if changes to Foo's mudlib are
                 necessary.
  foo/...      : additional files, e.g. installation hints taken from
                 the lib distribution.

If a special 'settings' file exists for the driver configuration, it is
stored in the main source tree as 'settings/foo'.


An exception is lp-245/ which contains the complete mudlib from old
LPMud 2.4.5. Think of it as a _very_ simple example mudlib, with the
added bonus value of demonstrating a) a traditional compat-mode master
with mudwho support, and b) how a mud can run in both compat and plain mode.


Support exists for these muds:

  StickLib - 0.99c (LDMud 3.2.7-dev.155)
    <URL:http://www.hut.fi/~doomdark/proj/sticklib/sticklib.html>

  Deeper Trouble - The 2nd Generation  (LDMud 3.2.8-dev.158)
    <URL:telnet://sunsite.auc.dk:4242/>

  Heaven7 3.1.1  (LDMud 3.2.9-dev.255)
    <URL:http://users.hunterlink.net.au/~demrh/heaven7/>


The following muds run natively on LDMud:

  OSB - 0.2.528 (LDMud 3.2.7-dev.123)
       <URL:ftp://osb.mud.de:4243/pub/lib/> (currently defunct)
    or <URL:ftp://ftp.bearnip.com/pub/mud/>

TODO: Complete this list (Tubmud, PK-Mud, Unitopia, etc)
