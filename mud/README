This directory contains the necessary files to adapt certain mudlibs
to run under LDMud, or vice versa.

The general structure for a mud Foo is this:

  foo/           holds all files related to Foo
  foo/INFO.txt : information about Foo and its relation to LDMud
  foo/src/     : source files and patches if changes to LDMud are necessary.
  foo/lib/     : source files and patches if changes to Foo's mudlib are
                 necessary.
  foo/...      : additional files, e.g. installation hints taken from
                 the lib distribution.

If a special 'settings' file exists for the driver configuration, it is
stored in the main source tree as 'settings/foo'.


An exception is lp-245/ which contains the complete mudlib from old
LPMud 2.4.5. Think of it as a _very_ simple example mudlib.


Support exists for these muds:

  StickLib - 0.99c (LDMud 3.2.7-dev.123)
    <URL:http://www.hut.fi/~doomdark/proj/sticklib/sticklib.html>


The following muds run natively on LDMud:

  OSB - 0.2.528 (LDMud 3.2.7-dev.123)
       <URL:ftp://osb.mud.de:4243/pub/lib/>
    or <URL:ftp://ftp.bearnip.com/pub/mud/>

TODO: Complete this list (Tubmud, Heaven7, PK-Mud, etc)
