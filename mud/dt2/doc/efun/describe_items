SYNOPSIS
        string describe_items (mixed * items, string func [, int live]);

DESCRIPTION
        Create a single descriptive string from the <items> and return it.
        If an error occurs, 0 is returned.
 
        <func> and plural_<func> are the functions used to create the
        short description from every dead item, for living things the
        functions query_looks() and plural_query_looks() are tried first.
        <live> is TRUE if the function shall look for living things among
        the items.
 
        The first element of <items> is a number and gives the count of
        items in the array, which are stored from index 1 upward. Every
        item is again described by a two-element array: first element is
        the number of objects to be described, second is the object itself.
        For example:
          ({ 2
           , ({ 3, /obj/torch })
           , ({ 1, /obj/key })
           , ({ 8, /obj/sword }) <-- ignored because beyond given count '2'
          })
