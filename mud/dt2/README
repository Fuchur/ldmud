Subject: Our mud-driver.

The MUD's name is Deeper Trouble - The Second Generation.

It was founded by some guys from the CS/MATH department of Aalborg
University, Denmark. It started back in 1990 I think. 10 years old. And we
still run an avarage of 25 players/5-7 wizzes. Not alot compared to all
the Gigantic muds, but still we hang in there. I just hope we can find a
place to put the machine (Pentium II 100mhz/400mhz with 256megs sdram and
4.5 gig HD - we actually shared the payment to this) for free on the net,
because this connection is not a very good one (proxies and all) and I am
not sure how much longer they will let us use them.

The administrator was a guy called Claus Skaaning. He has commented most
of his changes with the string "Kickaha" - his mudname..

The mud is located behind a firewall, but has set up proxies at
 sunsite.auc.dk 4242

I don't think the driver has any other name than Amylaar 3.2.1@141 with
personal modifications.
