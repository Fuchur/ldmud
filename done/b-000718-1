 --> Not reproducible.

Hullow, I have a couple of problems with you LDMud-driver... First of all
I can't download it from ftp.bearnip.com, so I can't get version 3.2.8. I
did however manage to download the last release version from ftp.mud.de.

Now, at first configure wouldn't make the files (config.h, machine.h and
makefile), but I used config.status for that. This might have been a
one-time error or something 'cause when I tried another time with
configure it seemed to work.

So why am I telling you this? Well, I'm not sure if it is somehow related
to my next problem. When doing 'make install' I keep getting this error
message:

make: *** [make_func.o] Error 1
------------------
I get errors with 'make' 'make utils' and 'make install-utils' too, though
I'm not sure if it's exactly the same message.

(retesting with 3.2.8-dev.216)

Nope, still won't work... Though now the errors are on line 52 and 391
instead... I'd use the windows-compiled version mentioned in the readme
file, but I'm wanna use the Heaven 7 library.
