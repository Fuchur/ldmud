Type: Bug
State: Done - pilot error.

2. Is valid_write()/valid_read() really called with the 'caller'
   argument? Cendor has problems with Heaven7 in this respect -
   caller is always 0.

Problem not reproducible with OSB mudlib.

Note: 'caller' is the euid of the calling object. In compat mode, there
  was no such thing.
