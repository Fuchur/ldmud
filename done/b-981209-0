Short: slow_shut_down is not used
Date: 981209
Type: Bug
State: Done - fixed in 3.2.8-dev.217

When the driver runs out of memory, it rapidly uses
up all reserves and then aborts. Something somehow eats
memory fast enough to prevent slow_shut_down from being
reached at all.

This is certainly the case when the garbage_collector runs into
a MAX_MALLOCED limit when swapping in all the objects.

3.2.8-dev.202 added an additional diagnostic for this case, printing
the amount of memory requested.

The reason: if the driver ran out of memory in a small block allocation
during a GC, the reserves were freed but the allocator didn't check the
freelists after doing so.
