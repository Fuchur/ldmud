Short: execute_command() crashes
Type: Bug
State: Done - fixed in 3.2.8-dev.171


eval execute_command("smile", this_player(), this_player()) in Cendors mud
first threw a privilege violation and then crashed without notice.

Analysis:

  When calling privilege_violation(), sp+1 instead of sp was passed as
  stackpointer, creating an uninitialized entry in the stack. Was the
  privilege denied, the error handling 'freed' this entry, causing
  a fandango on the core.
