One thing I'd definitely like to change in mapping behavior is to pass
the keys of a mapping to filter_mapping() and map_mapping(), the way they
are passed to walk_mapping(). There's a couple places where I'd like to be
able to deal with these values without either indexing the original mapping
inside filter_mapping(), or deleting bits of it inside walk_mapping(). The
problem is allowing it to be compatible to code that uses the extra
arguments to map_ or filter_mapping(). (map_mapping() will probably still
only be able to return a width-1 mapping, but that's not a big deal...)
