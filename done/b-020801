Short: nmap crashes LDMud
From: Kees Leune (C.J.Leune@kub.nl)

Type: Bug
State: Done - implemented in 3.2.9

When a collegue of mine ran an nmap scan over our mud's box, it caused the
driver to crash. This behaviour can be reproduced on demand. We are running
LDMud 3.2.8 (with local modifications) on a Linux-i386 box. The
modifications we made relate to adding ANSI support to the driver at string
creation time.

Is this a known problem? If so, are there any patches available? I was not
able to find this on your LDMud site.

Some info:
  MUD name: Hyperborea
  Address : hyperborea.net 2000 (137.56.40.93 2000)
  Driver  : ldmud 3.2.8 (-hyperborea1) in COMPAT mode
  Platform: Linux-i386

-- The reason was that 3.2.8 aborted on unexpected errors on accept()
(in this case: connection reset by peer). This has been changed in 3.2.9 .
