Short: catch_tell() vs non-interactive snoopers

Type: Bug
State: Done - not a bug.

The bug was caused by a buggy EotL patch.

Description:

I actually have a list of things that one of my Arches (Devo) has
compiled over the years that are either feature-desires or
bug-reports.  Here are a few bugs that we have verified are still
around:

-   strings get garbled when you give a non-interactive snooper
    a catch_tell()

This one, he says, has gotten even worse than it was before.  I
wonder, though, if this has something to do with our hacked-in
catch_tell() behavior.  Perhaps you could take a look at that, too,
and tell me what I did wrong.  I basically just threw code in that was
written by Xurbax back around 3.2.1@114. (!)
