- A "notify_success"-Hook
  A driverhook that will be called if the processing of a command has
  successfully been completed, as a counterpart to the notify-fail-Hook.

Note: if the command handling is removed from the driver, it won't
be necessary anymore. Else, better make it 'notify_command_complete'.
