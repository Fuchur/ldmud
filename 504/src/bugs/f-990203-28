void raise_caller_error(string msg, object caller = previous_object())

  Works like raise_error, except that the error is attributed
  to <caller>, not this_object().

  <caller> must be in the current call stack!

Maybe make this an extension of raise_error() itself.

Note: can be done in an sefun using caller_stack() and set_this_object()?
Note: could also be called raise_error()
