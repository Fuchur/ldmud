--------- About the driver patch ------------

With this patch it is possible that players can connect with telnet using both
IPv4 and v6. Since format and size of an ip address has changed, several
related functions (in driver and mudlib) still have problems.

This 'port' is quite a hack, but it seems to work for now. Probably you'll
get real problems as soon as you try to run a real mud with it.

--------- Using IP v6: --------------

In order to test IPv6 under Linux you need a 2.2.x kernel (preferably 2.2.10
or better) and the inet6 apps. If you use glibc 2.0, you need version 0.35
of the inet6 apps, or for glibc 2.1 you need version 0.36. The apps should
installed into /usr/inet6.

The apps are available on ftp.inner.net or on its mirrors, e.g.

 <URL:ftp://6bone.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/pub/ftp.inner.net/pub/ipv6/inet6-apps-0.35.tar.gz>

resp.

 <URL:ftp://6bone.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/pub/ftp.inner.net/pub/ipv6/inet6-apps0.36.tar.gz>

Furthermore you need a connection to the 6bone
(<URL:http://www.join.uni-muenster.de/>).
