SYNOPSIS
	string *inherit_list(object ob)

DESCRIPTION
	Returns the names of all files currently inherited by <ob>, including
        <ob>s own filename. If <ob> is omitted, it defaults to the current
        object.

        'Currently' in the above sentence means that after a replace_program()
        <ob>s 'own filename' is that of the object providing the replacement
        program.
