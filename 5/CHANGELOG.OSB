17-May-1998 (Lars Duening)
    - Release 3.2.1@141-osb.14
    - (interpret.c) The apply cache is initialized on driver startup, not
      statically at compilation time. This allows compilers with less
      capable preprocessors (line length limitations) to use big caches
      as well.

16-May-1998 and before (Lars Duening)
    - added rxcache.[ch]: cache for compiled regular expression patterns.
    - added support for BeOS.
    - (backend.c) Automatic garbage collections are kept at least 5 minutes
      apart. Every garbage collection is logged on stdout.
    - (backend.c) Variables are swapped independantly from program code.
    - (comm1.c, main.c) Multiple login ports may be used in parallel. The
      port numbers are given on the commandline, efun query_mud_port()
      was extended to return the appropriate port number.
    - (interpret.c) MudOS-efun terminal_colour() added by Mica.
    - (interpret.c) this_object() in destructed objects does not print a
      diagnostic anymore.
    - (lex.c) more informative diagnostics about defbuf allocations. Too
      big defbufs are deallocated again to conserve memory.
    - (main.c) reallocation of system reserves prints diagnostics.
    - (regexp.ch) NSUBEXP may take values different from 10 (OSB uses 50).
    - (swap.c) Free space is reused immediately.
    - (stralloc.ch, interpret.c) All the names of the lfuns applied by
      the driver are stored in the shared string table on startup.
      Together with some modifications to the apply cache for faster
      processing of applys on shared strings, this should make a mud
      a wee bit faster. Also added some comments in these ares (with
      no guarantee for correctness!).
    - (simulate.c) 'status tables' prints the number of cache hits both
      absolute and as percentage.
