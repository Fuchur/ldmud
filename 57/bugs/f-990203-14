string or_bits(string, string)
string xor_bits(string, string)
string and_bits(string, string)
  Expand the use of string bitfields, somewhat.

int next_bit(string|int, int)
  This would be immensly handy to traverse a string|int bitfield.
  Second argument is the bit to start with.
  Returns the position of the next bit.

> well, then also a way to find the next 0 bit, please.
