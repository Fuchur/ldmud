SYNOPSIS
	mapping m_reallocate(mapping m, int width)

DESCRIPTION
	Create a new mapping with <width> values per key and fill it
	with the values from mapping <m>. If <m> has less than <width>
	values per key, the extra values in the result are set to 0.
	If <m> has more values per key, the extra values are ignored.

	The mapping <m> is not changed.

EXAMPLE
	mapping m = ([ "foo":1;2;3, "bar":4;5;6 ])

	m_rewidth(m, 1) --> returns ([ "foo":1,       "bar:4 ])
	m_rewidth(m, 4) --> returns ([ "foo":1;2;3;0, "bar:4;5;6;0 ])

BUGS
	The name 'rewidth' is not very nice; but something like
	'chwidth' on the other hand is a bit cryptic. Anybody having
	a better name?

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.2.6, suggested by TubMud.
