Short: Crasher in regreplace()
Date: 981202
Type: Bug
State: Fixed.

Zora@PK-Mud tells you: pk ist grad gecrashed, wegen
regreplace("acc", "a*", "yy",1).

It crashes after several calls (90..100) in smalloc.c with
a messed up stack, apparently trying to free memory which was
never allocated. Using c-alloca() doesn't help.

Compiling with SMALLOC_TRACE (and _LPC_TRACE) causes a
fatal error on the second call:

  remove_from_free_list: magic match failed

at various places.

Unreproducible under BeOS and SunOS.

Reason: the reallocation-on-the-fly in f_regreplace() was
triggered one byte too late.
