PRELIMINARY
SYNOPSIS
        string *include_list ()
        string *include_list (object ob)
        string *include_list (object ob, int flags)


DESCRIPTION
        Returns the names of all files included into the compilation
        of <ob>, including <ob> program's own filename.
        If <ob> is omitted, it defaults to the current object.
        The value of <flags> is currently ignored.

        The result is an array of filenames, starting the with the filename
        of <ob>'s program itself, followed by the names of all included files
        in the order they were encountered during compilation.

        If objects, including <ob>, had been undergone a replace_program(),
        the returned filenames will reflect the actual active program.

        The returned names always begin with '/' (absolute path), except
        when the parser runs in COMPAT mode.


EXAMPLES
        Given this source code:

          a.c:  #include "b.c"
                #include "c.c"
          b.c:  #include "d.c"

        the efun will give these results:

          include_list(a) -> ({ "a.c", "b.c", "d.c", "c.c" })
          include_list(b) -> ({ "b.c", "d.c" })

BUGS
        At the moment, this efun is only minimally useful:
         - only include files for which code was generated are listed
         - the names of the files appear as they were given in the source
         - no flag for ""- and <>-type includes.


HISTORY
        Introduced in an experimental form in LDMud 3.2.9.
