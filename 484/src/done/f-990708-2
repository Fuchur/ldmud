I'm missing a string size

Example: when a max. eval cost of 1000000 is allowed, a
simple codeline like "string t; t = ""; for(;t += "a";);"
hangs up the driver for more than 30 minutes.
In my eyes this is not acceptable, because every "little"
wizard can keep down the MUD on this way.

Note: string size limits don't help because the driver slows down for
  even moderately long strings (40KByte). Dynamic costs are much
  more effective.
