SYNOPSIS
    object clone_object(string name)
    object clone_object(object template)

DESCRIPTION
    Clone a new object from definition <name>, or alternatively from
    the object <template>. In both cases, the new object is given 
    an unique name and returned.
	
    The original, called blue print, used for cloning, should not be
    used in the system, only be used for cloning. The cloned objects
    contain only the data but the blue print also the function code.
    The blue print is the one without a unique number at the end of
    the object's file_name(). The clone_object() function never
    returns a blue print.
	
    Note that the pathname must be complete, which means there are no
    relative paths allowed.

EXAMPLE
    // Clone a torch
    object torch;
    torch = clone_object("/obj/torch");

    // Clone two keys
    object key1, key2;
    key1 = clone_object(load_object("/obj/key"));
    key2 = clone_object(key1);

BUGS
    clone_object(object) gives interesting results if the given object
    is a virtual object: it then uses the real blueprint name instead
    of the virtual one.i
