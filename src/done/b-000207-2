Short: query_notify_fail() fails
Type: Bug
State: Abandoned - not reproducible

Hi, I had a chat you a while ago and you asked me to mail you these two
probelsm I'm facing when using H_COMMAND hook. The hook looks like this:

    set_driver_hook(H_COMMAND,
     unbound_lambda( ({ 'cmd, 'cmd_giver }),
       ({ #',,
         ({ #'=, 'cmd, ({ #'call_other, 'cmd_giver, "modify_command", 'cmd }) }),
         ({ #'=, 'res,
           ({ #'execute_command, 'cmd, 'cmd_giver, ({ #'this_object }) }),
         }),
         ({ #'?!, 'res,
           ({ #'write, ({ #'+, ({ #'query_notify_fail, 0 }), "\n" }) })
         }),
         ({ #'return, 'res }),
       })));

Though it isn't really what it will be after it works ;). There is a
problem. The query_notify_fail() keeps returning 0, I bet I'm doing
something wrong or not? And the another problem is: I have
add_action("CommandParser", "", 1); which isn't parsed at all with this
hook. Some of the commands tho work ok w/o problems but notify_fail() and
this add_action() aren't working.

  Thanks in advance, Manu aka Cendor@Winterkill

Analysis:
  Not reproducible so far.
