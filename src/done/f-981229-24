3) strtrim(), which cuts a specified character (usually spaces) off

Matthew Julius explains:

varargs string strtrim(string, int, int)
  First argument is the string to trim.
  Second argument is the character to trim.
  Third argument is a bit field designating to trim from the right, left,
  or both sides.  Also, a fourth option, perhaps, to filter the character
  from the entire string.
  For examples,
    strtrim("  abc  ", ' ',   1) == "abc  "
    strtrim("  abc  ", ' ', 1|2) == "abc"
    strtrim("  abc  ", ' ',   2) == "  abc"
  The Timewarp mudlib has historically called this trimstr().

Matthew Julius answers:

Actually, Timewarp has never supported regreplace()...
Ever since the first day we compiled the GD with it and it crashed the GD.
We also had a sefun/efun regsubst() which was more robust than regreplace()
at the time, but it never materialized and now we have neither.  I still
harbor a dislike of regreplace() for some reason though.
