I noticed that the multiport support is already there, this is fine.
hmm, but, how can i say... is it possible to change/patch the driver so
that we can define individual access lists for each port?
here, in my university, students do not have permission to log into the
mud using some specific labratories. I have fingerd-like thing running on
port 79, i want them to be able to use finger in those labratories at
least.
