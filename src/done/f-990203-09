Short: Driver hook for add_action()

Type: Feature
State: Done - obsoleted by H_COMMAND in 3.2.7-dev.127

Driver hook to store the name of the function to call in an interactive
object after modify_command() has been called.  This function actually
executes the command with query_verb() defined appropriately.
This allows the mudlib to determine whether or not to eliminate add_action().
add_action("cmd_hook", "", 1) is no longer needed in living objects for
those that choose not to use add_action().
The function name could also be an unbound lambda closure I suppose, but
I would not use this myself.

Note: can't this be done as part of the MODIFY_CMD processing?
