Hi Lars.

I have a problem on my mud that are kinda funny.
The players have notice that they can do "free" emotes...

It works like this.
They use a client like putty, SecureCRT.
First they write say they hit left arrow 9 times, then they enter what they want to do like "the world hates you"
and press enter, now everyone in the rooms se this.
If iam not wrong its beacuse of "colors", the trick is that they manage to do the : 

Any ide how to fix this? I have tryed some other muds, and they have the same error.
