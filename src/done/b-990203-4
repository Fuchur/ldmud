Type: Bug
State: Done - 3.2.7 uses a new configuration system.

Hello Mateese, I hear you are the one to contact for LD driver problems.

I have Redhat Linux 5.1, and the regular Amylaar driver compiles fine.
In the directions I run ./configure and then "make install"
This part works ok...
But when it comes time to "make install.utils" I end up getting an
error.  I was wondering if you ever encountered something like this before?

Thanks for your time.
