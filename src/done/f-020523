i  Do case-insensitive pattern matching.
If use locale is in effect, the case map is taken from the current 
locale. See perllocale.

m  Treat string as multiple lines. That is, change "^" and "$" from 
matching the start or end of the string to matching the start or end 
of any line anywhere within the string.

s  Treat string as single line. That is, change "." to match any 
character whatsoever, even a newline, which normally it would not 
match.

The /s and /m modifiers both override the $* setting. That is, no 
matter what $* contains, /s without /m will force "^" to match only 
at the beginning of the string and "$" to match only at the end (or 
just before a newline at the end) of the string. Together, as /ms, 
they let the "." match any character whatsoever, while yet allowing 
"^" and "$" to match, respectively, just after and just before 
newlines within the string.

x  Extend your pattern's legibility by permitting whitespace and 
comments.

-- This change would require a rewrite of the ed() command parser,
and is not really necessary as the modifiers can be specified inline
in the PCRE expression.
