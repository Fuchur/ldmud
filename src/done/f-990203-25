string|void save_object(int|string)
  If the argument is an integer (!0), instead of writing to a file, return
  the data as a string.  This allows the current state of an object to be
  saved without hitting the filesystem.  Also, save_object() should not
  save variables with a value of 0.

void restore_object(string)
  Similar to save_object(), but the argument can be a filename, or the
  string returned by save_object().  That is, a filename will not start
  with "#0:0...", or whatever the current version of save_object() may be.
  Again, this allows the state of an object to be restored without a hit
  to the filesystem.
