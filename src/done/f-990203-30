> - Get rid of the light-handling in the driver

Absolutely. If there was anything that the driver doesn't need to know
about, it's light. This can be trivially simulated in the mudlib if
necessary. The only reason I could think of for keeping it would be to
rename it to something generic, and use it as a "programmer-specific"
object property. Delphi has something like this (forget what it's called,
but it's a generic value that all objects have which was specifically put
there for use by the programmer in any manner they saw fit).

But even that sounds like a hack to me. ;-)
