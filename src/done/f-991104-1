Subject: Inline closures are not real closures.

Inline closures still lack the ability to use the values of
the local vars of their creating function.

void foo(string name) {
  funcall( (: name :) );
}

for example does not compile. There is of course the problem
of distinguishing environment- and closurelocal variables.
