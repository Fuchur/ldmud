I noticed a change in the behaviour of the input_to function from 3.2.7 to
3.2.8.dev.221(checked)

i used the INPUT_CHARMODE option to receive a single char.

Continues working fine if i use it in pure telnet mode.
But if i use a clinet (tinyfugue), which forces a \n to accept the input
i got strange results.
With 3.2.7 i got the key i typed, but with 3.2.8 i got back a strange string
containing -3 (hex $FC) and at the second call a +3 (hex $03) if i type
just return. 
The result is the same, if i entered another key before i type return.

I'm confused with the output, all i want is a code which detects just the
key i type, wether with or without a client. worked fine with 3.2.7, but no idea
how to do in 3.2.8. Please help !

Anyway, u did a great work, updating to 3.2.8 discovers many coding
errors :)
Keep goind on to bring us soon the official 3.2.8

Happy coding, have fun
