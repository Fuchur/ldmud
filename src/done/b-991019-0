The problem is that "short" is lexed as L_LOCAL instead of
the L_IDENTIFIER expected by the function_call rule.

Adding L_LOCAL to the function_name rule is possible, but would
require extra handling to avoid

   string short;

   short()

A L_LOCAL handling could consist in finding the definition hidden
by the LOCAL identifier, or by amending the functino_call rules
to check the type of the identifier.
