Short: vararg tefun recognition faulty
Date: 990320
From: Lars
Type: Bug
State: Done - corrected in 3.2.8-dev.150

In the %tefun part of func_spec, a definition of the form

    type foo(void|type)

is not recognized as varargs tefun.

--- Solution ---

The check for "tefun or vefun" just checked the flag limit_max,
but not the actual number of arguments. The fix is obvious.
