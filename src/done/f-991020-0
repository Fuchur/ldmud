inherit_list() should offer options which control which data is returned
how: flat/depth/width search, flat or nested result, with or without flags.
This may require a redesign in the handling of inherit structures.

--- LDMud 3.2.9-dev.355/3.3.111 implements the return of a tree structure.

A particular nasty scenario is:

  ------ c.c ------
  int j;
  ------ b.c ------
  virtual inherit "c";
  ------ a.c ------
  inherit "b";
  virtual inherit "c";

inherit_list("a") returns ({ "a.c", "c.c", "b.c", "c.c" })
The last "c.c" is the same as the first "c.c", but is found when doing
the search in "b.c" - the connection is not visible there.
