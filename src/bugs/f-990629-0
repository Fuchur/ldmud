Short: Error handling within a catch.

Immediate error handling should be independent from a catch(), as too
many people forget to handle errors returned by a catch.

Maybe a modification to runtime/heartbeat/log_error, giving an extra
parameter 'is_caught', and if is_caught is true, the return value decides
if the driver prints a traceback or not before doing the actual catch.

In general, the error and diagnostic handling is much too confused.
