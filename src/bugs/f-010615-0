Short: Implementing ID# based svalues
From: Lars

Type: Idea

If identifying values by id#, an svalue could be extended to hold 
either the id'ed and the real values:

  T_OBJECT: the string by id
  T_M_OBJECT: the object pointer itself

During an execution, all id'd values are as needed transformed into 
normal svalues. Afterwards, all changes can be made back into id's.
