Personally I tend in the same direction that MudOS went: only an interactive
object can send data over the network (MudOS uses the efun receive() for
that). Everything else is done on the mudlib level because the requirements
and architectures of the various mudlibs tend to vary significantly.

I can imagine the driver offering support in form of a multicast-call_other,
e.g. call_room(room, exclude, function, args...).
