An efun that would be quite useful, 

clear_input_to()

would display the prompt to this_player(), and cancel
the call to the function specified by the last
input_to(), provided that this_player() has been given
an input_to(), thus returning them to there regular
command-giving selves.

Note:
  Better would be something like
    remove_input_to(void|string|closre) (implemented in 3.2.9-dev.355/3.3.119)
  and of course
    input_to_list()
