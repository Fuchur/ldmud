Short: call_out handling freezes
From: Manu Maeki (Cendor)
Date: 000308
Type: Bug
State: Maybe fixed in 3.2.9-dev.256
Driver: 3.2.8-dev.163

After some time, the call_out handling stops and doesn't restart until
a reboot. This happens only if this change is in effect: heartbeats are
stopped while players are not in the vicinity.

Ask Cendor to sent again their monster.c

Does the call_out handling skip objets which eval_costs are expired?

Analysis: Fiona discovered that on some systems SIGALRM is blocked when
the program starts. Code to unblock the signal has been added in
3.2.9-dev.256.
