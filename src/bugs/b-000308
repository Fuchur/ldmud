Short: call_out handling freezes

After some time, the call_out handling stops and doesn't restart until
a reboot. This happens only if this change is in effect: heartbeats are
stopped while players are not in the vicinity.

Ask Cendor to sent again their monster.c

Does the call_out handling skip objets which eval_costs are expired?
