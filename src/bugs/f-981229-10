speaking of such: i'd like a truncate_file() efun which truncates files
(you guessed that from the name already?).  the current simulefun
implementation in TubMud for that function is rather ugly, copying the
file to a new one until the truncate position is reached and then removing
the original and renaming the copy.  for copying it also has to work
around the read/write_bytes limitation.

Note: make this a special mode of copy_file(),
e.g. copy_file(from,to,start,len)?
