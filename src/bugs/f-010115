When looking for n-Byte small Blocks,consider splitting a free >n-Byte Block.

During a GC, coalesce adjacent free small blocks. This would require rebuilding
all freelists, which could be done simply by scanning for GC_FREE small blocks.

When coalescing small blocks, maybe allow 'odd' sizes. These could be held in a separate free list, and used in a 'splitting' maneuver if the appropriate free list is exhausted.
