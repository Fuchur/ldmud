Short: Revamp the bytecode design

Redesign the bytecode so that it uses 16- or 32-Bit Words: masking and shifting
on modern processors should be faster than memory accesses. Note: on x86 using
16-Bit words in 32-Bit code might be slow.

Investigate changing the stackmachine into a registermachine, e.g. instead of

   load var1
   load var2
   add
   store var3

the bytecode would be

   add var1, var2, var3

The compiler might be complexer, but it could speed up the machine.

Also, think about storing the addresses of the instruction routines directly
in the 'bytecode'.
