Short: Automatic member initialisation for structs

Vielleicht wäre es schön wenn man schon member initialisieren könnte...
z.b. :

struct Test {
  int a;
  string b;
  mixed *c=({});
};

-------
This would be possible with another 'internal' function, holding the
code to setup the struct members. The function would have to be inherited in
parallel with the struct, which would happen automatically anyway. The struct
definition would have a flag saying if the  function exists. If yes, any call
to S_AGGREGATE would also have a reference to the function.
