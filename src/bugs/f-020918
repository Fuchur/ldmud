Short: Generic function call operator

The function call operator() should be implemented as proper operator, so that
code as in ' closure cl = ...; cl();' becomes possible (funcall() and apply()
would serve the cases where a 'call' of a non-closure should be possible).

This would also mean that object->name returns just a lfun-closure.
