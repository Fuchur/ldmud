Okay, I suggest to change format of the fun a bit, to the following:

varargs string terminal_colour( string str
                              , null|mapping|closure map
                              , int wrap | string wrap
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                              , int indent )

where "int wrap" remains almost the same, except for it begins
to serve right justification.

"string wrap" will serve following:

"n-" <- left justification
"n|" <- centering
"n$" <- flushing
where 'n' is a number of columns

I think, this is not too hard to implement. And is not against current
ideology of the linewrapping in the function.
