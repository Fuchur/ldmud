This directory holds know bugs, patches and feature requests, one per file.

The filenames follow the pattern 'f-yymmdd-x' for features, 'b-yymmdd-x'
for bugs, and 'p-yymmdd-x' for contributed patches. Complete issues are
moved over to the directory ../done.

<yymmdd> is the date when the original issue was raised.
<x> is an arbitrary number to distinguish requests raised on the same day
    and may be omitted.

f-summary summarizes most(!) of the feature and patch submissions.
b-summary summarizes all bug reports.
