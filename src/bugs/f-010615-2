Short:Efficient vector implementation

Use HATs (DDJ July 2001) for vector modifications, 
essentially implementing 'dirty' and 'condensed' vectors.

The vector could be combined: the normal fixed length in one block,
plus the extensions as HAT. Very short arrays could be fully stored in the
vector control block, to save space.
