When writing data to the network, the driver drops messages when
encountering an EWOULDBLOCK.

This is ok for normal game usage, but deadly when used as e.g. httpd.
Either a synchronous write() is implemented (not easy, as it requires
buffering in the comm.c module) and/or we implement the TCP efuns.
