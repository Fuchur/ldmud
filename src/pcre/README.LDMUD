This is PCRE, stripped down to what is required by the LDMud gamedriver.
The files README and COPYING tell you where to get the complete package.

The file internal.h was modified so that it is protected against multiple
inclusion.

The file pcre.c was modified: a function macro was inserted at the place
of the backtracking in match() where the code detects that a bracket
match failed.
