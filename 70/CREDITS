The program was originally written by

Lars Pensj|, April 1989 (lars@cd.chalmers.se (no longer valid)).

Lars gives the following credit:

  The regexp package was made by Henry Spencer.

  The ed package was not done by me. See the file ed.c for information.

  Bit manipulations was implemented by pell@lysator.liu.se who also found
  several bugs that had eluded me for months.

  Valuable help and hints from: Mark Nagel, James Seidman, Moonchilde and more.

  Roland Dunkerley III fixed for-loops, do-while and the operators ++ and --.

  Sean T Barrett made smalloc.c.

  Lennart Augustsson convinced me to implement a compiler for a virtual
  stack machine. He also implemented the built-in preprocessor.

  John S. Price found and fixed many bugs.

  The shadow idea was "forwarded" to me by John S. Price from Team Cthulhu
  (Bill Burdick, Roy Riggs, Mitch Adler).

  Michael Malone, Michael O'Reilly, Klaus Rennecke, J|rn Rennecke and
  Germano Caronni found and fixed a large amount of bugs.

  Petri Wessman fixed changes for SCO unix and AIX.

Joern Rennecke ( amylaar@cs.tu-berlin.de ) gives this credit:

  The non-corrupting indentation code for ed was written by Felix A. Croes,
  aka Dworkin (<felix@dworkin.nl>) and originates from his DGD.

  Mud-sprintf() is from Lynscar (Sean A Reith, <gusar@uniwa.oz.au> and
  was donated into the Public Domain.

  The alist based mapping implementation was supplied by Dworkin.

  The idea for query_actions and an implementation that has been partially used
  is from Peter Eriksson (aka lpd) pen@lysator.liu.se

  The port to Amiga was done by Mateese ( Lars Duening )

  The udp connectivity is from the CD driver, and was fitted in by deepthought.

  Demos, Freaky, Hurl, Hyp, Mateese, Pepel and Jof did a lot of alpha
  testing.

  Reimer Behrends located a lot of bugs. He also supplied a portable macro to
  test numbers for having but a single bit set, a mergesort based
  sort_array() and variadic function support.

  get_object_actions() was supplied by herp.

  Marcus Meissner found and fixed many bugs.

  Slider@Tubmud supplied GnuWin32 patches.
