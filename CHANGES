Changes from 1.4.0-A to 1.4.1-A

Fixed several more bugs.  These constitute the majority of changes.  Among
others, changes were made to the wizard shutdown and time commands, the
player describe command, the initial loading routine, the error handling
routine, and monster.c.  (This list is far from complete.)

Upon an error, players are now moved to the church instead of to the void,
assuming the game is able to do this.  Everything else still goes to the
void.

The ability to put traps on doors was added.  See /doc/build/door for details.

The ability to use "stat" has been changed (in the version of security.h
included here) to allow anyone of CREATE level to use it.  However, living.h
has been changed so that unless the wizard is of at least STAT level, he
will not see the monster's current hp, so he can't tip off players.
