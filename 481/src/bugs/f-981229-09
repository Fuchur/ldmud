ah, another thing: i'd like an optional second argument to allocate(),
which should be the value to initially fill the array with.  e.g.:
allocate(5,3.1) ==> ({ 3.1, 3.1, 3.1, 3.1, 3.1 }).

Implement something similar for clone_object() and (new) load_object(),
with the additional args passed to create().
