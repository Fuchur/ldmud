Is there a way in LPC to do the following?
I don't know the proper terminology, so I'll just
write the C++ code and describe it.

enum{HEAD, CHEST, LARM, RARM, LLEG, RLEG};

This would make HEAD = 0, CHEST = 1, LARM = 2, etc...
and allow them to be used just like numbers.
so HEAD + 1 would = 1 or it could = CHEST

Thanks
Brandon
