The MudOS way of specifying reference arguments in the function signatures
make more sense than the Amylaar way of modifying the actual arguments.
Beek gives a good reason:

It can be argued if requiring the 'ref' in the function call is a good
thing or not, but it is a reminder to the programmer.

It can even be used to pass constant variables/literals for such arguments:

  void foo(ref int x);
  
  foo(5)  -> GD creates a temporary int, assigns 5 and passes it as argument
  foo(ref 5) -> compile-time error
