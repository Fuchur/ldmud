SYNOPSIS
	string program_name()
	string program_name(object obj)

DESCRIPTION
        Return the name of the program of <obj>, resp. the name of the
        program of the current object if <obj> is omitted.

        The returned name is usually the name from which the blueprint
        of <obj> was compiled (the 'load name'), but changes if an object
        replaces its programs with the efun replace_programs().

        The name always ends in '.c'. It starts with a '/' unless the
        driver is running in COMPAT mode.

EXAMPLE
	object o;
	o = clone_object("/std/thing");
	write(program_name(o));  --> writes "/std/thing.c" in !compat mode
	                                and "std/thing.c"  in compat mode
HISTORY
	Introduced in LDMud 3.2.6.
