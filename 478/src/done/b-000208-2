Short: Mazemaster in OSB stopped working in 164
From: Nostradamus (RZ@zitz.dk)
Date: 000208
Type: Bug
State: Done - not a bug.

The rooms used incorrect pathnames.

Description:

You wrote a 'maze' here using the mazemaster I believe, 
compile_object() etc
/p/school/examples/lpc/xmace0.c
for some reason the small area seems to work ok with dev156 but not 
with dev164
it looks like it doesn't compile the virtual rooms as it should
either way I get errors about destination object being 0
