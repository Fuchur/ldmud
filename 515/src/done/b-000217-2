Short: terminal_colour() fails
Date: 000217
Type: Bug
State: Done - fixed in 3.2.8-dev.175.

Dafire@FinalFrontier tells you: qlpc return
   terminal_colour("test123REPtest123",(["REP":"REPLACED"]),4,3); 
crasht den
   driver.. der sagt dann noch: 2000.02.17 17:24:23 Length 
miscalculated in
   terminal_colour(); Expected: 62 Was: 59;  String: 
test123REPtest123;
   Indent: 3 Wrap: 4

3.2.8-dev.164

Analysis:
  The problem was the indentation combined with the wrapping in the
  middle of the word 'test123': the code didn't expect the last line
  to show up and omitted the indentation space, which then accounted
  for the missing but expected space in the sanity check.
