I actually have a list of things that one of my Arches (Devo) has
compiled over the years that are either feature-desires or
bug-reports.  Here are a few bugs that we have verified are still
around:

-   padding a %d in (s)printf() with left justification doesn't 
    work if the type specifier isn't followed by anything.  
    (ie. sprintf("%' '-9d", 1500) doesn't work, while 
    sprintf("%' '-9dx", 1500) does).
