This file lists all changes to the game driver which have a visible
impact on its behaviour both towards the mudlib as well as towards
the host system.

For a detailed list of all changes see the file CHANGELOG.

16-Jun-1999 (Lars Duening) -- upcoming Release 3.2.7

    - Changed efuns:
        + destruct(): accepts an already destructed object as argument.
        + inherit_list(), debug_info(), object_info(): duplicate virtual
            inherits are no longer listed.
        + replace_program(): no longer flags objects as 'clones', but
            instead uses the new flag 'O_REPLACED'.
        + sprintf(), printf(): if an error occurs, the filename and line
            are included in all error messages, not just the one printed
            to stderr.
        + symbol_function(): can't make closures from protected lfuns of
            other objects anymore.

    - Corrected efuns:
        + caller_stack(): is now declared to return 'object *' as it
            indeed does.
        + query_mud_port(): now accepts 'int' arguments as documented.
        + restore_object(): protected against negative '([:<width>])'
            specifications.
        + (s)printf(): prints variable closures properly even if the
            variable vanished in a program replacement.
        + symbol_variable(): recognizes objects with pending program
            replacements.
        + to_object(): returns 0 for closures bound to a destructed
            object.
        + to_string(): converts variable closures properly even if the
            variable vanished in a program replacement.
        + unmkmapping(): now handles key-only mappings as it should.

    - Fixed Crashers:
        + A heart_beat() removing all remaining objects on the hb list.
        + An error during a (s)efun bound to a swapped out object could
          crash the dump_trace.
        + An error during macro expansion crashed the driver if the error
          handling itself required macro expansion again.
        + to_string() on a lfun of a swapped program.
        + call_lambda() on not-inherited variable closures.
        + replace_program() on a program of which one variable is referenced
          by a symbol_variable().
        + Swap in of a closure variable which was invalidated during
          a garbage collection.
        + Binding an unbound lambda to two objects and destructing
          the originating object freed the lambda.

    - Other Changes:
        + Tweaks to the timing of swapping, cleanup() and reset() to
            achieve a smoother operation.
        + On loading errors, the name of the affected object is printed
            in the error message.
        + The multiport feature is no longer optional.
        + Corrections to the manpages of clone_object, clonep, filter_mapping,
            filter_indices.
        + Support for alien-lfun closures was incomplete.
        + If hook H_RESET is a closure, and the closure returns a negative
            value, the object will not be reset again, asi
            if set_next_reset(-1) had been used.
        + '+=' now allows to add an int onto a float (before only floats
            were allowed). Similar for '-=', '*=' and '/='.
        + Bugfix: Variables in closures may start with '_'.
        + Bugfix: *::f() did not call all inherited functions (and others
            multiple times).
        + Bugfix: '#[<] indexing corrected.
        + Bugfix: Reset of swapped objects did not work properly.
        + Bugfix: Errors during the execution of closures no longer leak
            memory.
        + Bugfix: Switching driver hooks from within themselves no longer
            leaks memory.
        + Bugfix: New callouts added from within a callout with odd delay
            resulted in the new callouts called at the wrong time. If the
            new callout had a MAX_INT delay, the current callout list
            was effectively disabled.


01-Apr-1999 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.6
    - Changed efuns:
        + allocate_mapping() renamed to m_allocate(). The old name
            is still available as alias.
        + clone_object() accepts objects as templates.
        + efun308() renamed to set_environment(). The old name is
            still available as alias.
        + file_name() renamed to object_name(). The old name is still
            available as alias.
        + filter_mapping() renamed to filter_indices(). The old name
            is still available as alias.
        + mapping_contains() renamed to m_contains(). The old name is
            still available as alias.
        + map_mapping() renamed to map_indices(). The old name
            is still available as alias.
        + mapping_contains() renamed to m_contains(). The old name is
        + m_values() can return any column of a mapping.
        + notify_fail() returns 0.
        + set_this_player() accepts 0 as argument.
        + to_int(), to_object() and to_float() accept their result
            type as argument.

    - Corrected efuns:
        + call_out(): if the command_giver destructs before the callout
            is activated, this_player() is made sure to be 0.
        + map_array() stumbled when objects in the array in question
            were destructed during the operation.
        + sizeof(mapping) no longer counts destructed objects in
            the mapping to the size.
        + sprintf() of float values < 1.0 no longer causes a SING error.
        + terminal_colour() correctly wraps strings with a length one less
            than the wrap limit.
        + this_interactive(): during login it points to the login object.

    - New efuns:
        + abs(): return the absolute value of the argument.
        + all_environment(): return all environments of an object.
        + caller_stack(): return the call stack.
        + clonep(): test if an object is a clone.
        + copy(): produce a shallow copy of the argument.
        + deep_copy(): produce a shallow copy of the argument.
        + filter(): filter an array or fill-width mapping.
        + load_name(): returns the filename of an objects blueprint.
        + load_object(): loads an object.
        + make_shared_string(): enters a string into the shared string table.
        + map(): map an array or full-width mapping.
        + m_reallocate(): changes the width of a mapping.
        + object_info(): returns internal information about an object.
        + program_name(): returns the name of an objects program.
        + set_next_reset(): set the time of the next reset.
        + unmkmapping(): deconstruct a mapping to arrays.
        + upper_case(): make a string all upper case.
        + widthof(): return the width of a mapping.

    - Master Object:
        + All functions can be static.
        + Functions like privilege_violation() or heart_beat_error(), but
            also valid_read() and valid_write() no longer receive destructed
            objects as arguments.
        + Apply 'object_name()' renamed to 'printf_obj_name()'.

    - Compiler:
        + New predefined macro __MAX_EVAL_COST__ expands to the evaluation
            cost limit.
        + Bugfix: __DOMAIN_NAME__ on some machines returned the NIS, not the
            DNS domain.
        + Bugfix: __MASTER_OBJECT__ could be set to a non-canonic name.
        + Bugfix: __FILE__ and __MASTER_OBJECT__ returned names with leading
            '/' in compat mode.
        + Bugfix: (virtual) inheritance of variable-only objects with
            variable initialisation doesn't crash the driver anymore.
        + Bugfix: #'++/#'-- in closures work.

    - Fixed Crashers:
        + Errors in a callout to an efun closure.
        + Adding arrays up to and over the upper limit.
        + Destruction of non-interactive snoopers.
        + funcall()/apply() on a swapped variable.

    - Other Changes:
        + The old behaviour of explode() and previous_object() is no longer
            available. Floats, transcendent functions, mappings and extended
            varargs are now permanent features of the driver.
        + Re-implemented the handling of heartbeats, resets, cleanups and
            swapping in order to avoid caused lags. This also makes
            the config parameter RESET_GRANULARITY unnecessary.
        + If used, the __INIT() function is protected instead of global, and
            can't be called from outside the objects anymore (it shouldn't be
            callable at all anyway).
        + When subtracting mappings from each other, the subtrahend may
            be of any width, but only its keys count.
        + The 'status tables' command has an additional entry 'Object status'.
        + Bugfix: fixed an eval cost leak in catch().
        + Bugfix: fixed memory leak in terminal_colour().
        + Bugfix: if a command disconnects, but not quits a player, the prompt
            is no longer printed (before it ended up on stdout, cluttering
            the logfiles).


10-Dec-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.5
    - Collapsing of '/' in object names also used for inherits.
    - Default limit for bitstrings is 6144 bits.
    - The efuns break_point() and swap() are disabled by default.
    - Pre-release versions have an extended version number of
        the form '3.2.5-dev.16'.
    - Compat mode drivers define __COMPAT_MODE__ (meant to replace
        COMPAT_FLAG eventually); native mode drivers define
        __NATIVE_MODE__.
        Similar, a driver using euids defines __EUIDS__.
    - New defines __ERQ_MAX_SEND__ and __ERQ_MAX_REPLY__ when the
        driver supports the ERQ. The values are the max sizes of
        the send and receive buffers (taken from x-erq by Brian Gerst).
    - MSDOS support removed (the MSDOS filesystem however is still
        supported).
    - It is now possible to use '..' in filenames as long as it
        doesn't has the 'parent directory' meaning (that means, 'foo..bar'
        is ok, bug 'foo/../bar' is not).
    - When a connection is closed, the driver no longer sends
        'Closing down' as last text.
    - Bugfix: branches in bigger lambda() closures use the correct
        branch offsets. I am not completely sure if the bugfix is
        correct, so I left in two 'DEBUG:' diagnostics with information
        needed to debug the code further if necessary.
    - Bugfix: the commandline parser printed a faulty error message
        if a required value was missing.
    - Bugfix: mapping_contains() freed the wrong values, clobbering
        passed mapping literals.
    - Bugfix: After an UDP packet was processed, the evaluation costs
        are restored (provided by Tucita).
    - Bugfix: The LPC compiler now accepts only regular files for includes.
    - Bugfix: If a npc was destructed between to command() calls, and
        the H_MODIFY_COMMAND hook was set to a string, the driver called
        the named modify-command function on the destructed npc.
    - Bugfix: During the execution of a closure, an extra refcount is
        added to protect it from destruction while it is executed. This
        is primarily a safety measure for the driver hooks which only
        have 1 refcount and are thus very sensitive against master object
        updates.
    - Bugfix: Under some OS like Linux, the normal SIG_IGN handler is
        just one-shot. To reliably ignore signals (ie SIGPIPE), a homemade
        handler is used.
    - Bugfix: regreplace("acc", "a*", "yy",1) trashed memory.
    - Bugfix: runtime errors in an alien-lfun-closure (as created by
        symbol_function() calls) no longer crash the driver during the
        error handling.
    - Bugfix: sprintf() on big floats or in long fields no longer causes
        a buffer overrun (and should it happen nevertheless, a proper
        fatal() is generated).


24-Sep-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.4
    - Bugfix for the collapsing of '/' in object names.

21-Sep-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.3
    - Bugfix: mapping_contains() no longer returns destructed objects.
        (found by Zora).
    - New special command 'status files' to append file usage statistics
        from within the mud to the file /FILESTAT.
    - New commandline option:
        --swap-compact: reuse free space in the swapfile immediately.
      Giving this option results in smaller, but also more fragmented
      swapfiles, and the swap performance may degrade.

14-Sep-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.2
    - Version number pattern changed from 03.02.1@<patchlevel>
      to 3.2.<patchlevel>. This affects all uses of the __VERSION__
      lpc predefine.
    - Objects may be loaded/inherited with filenames containing two or
      more consecutive '/'es, these are collapsed into just one.
      However, it is not possible to find objects using the wrong
      names. (suggested by Zora)
    - The dreaded __INIT() bug is fixed (provided by mubo).
    - New commandline options:
        --options : prints all options used in compiling the driver
        --version : prints the game driver version
        --help    : prints a short help of the commandline options
        --longhelp: prints an elaborate description of the commandline
                    options
    - The commandline option handling was renovated, most options now
      exist in a short and long form. This caused slight changes in
      name and syntax for well-known options (.e.g '--gcollect_out_fd<file>'
      is now '--gcollect-out-fd <file>'). Please see doc/driver/invocation
      for further information.

10-Jul-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.1@141-osb.16
    - Bugfix for the "*":: problem (provided by Daniel von Dincklage).
    - Added a minimal master for simple driver tests.

17-May-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.1@141-osb.14 and before
    - Small speedup for regexps through usage of a cache. Also increased
      the complexity limit for regexps.
    - Added support for BeOS.
    - Automatic garbage collections are kept at least 5 minutes
      apart. Every garbage collection is logged on stdout.
    - Variables are swapped independantly from program code.
    - Multiple login ports may be used in parallel. The
      port numbers are given on the commandline, efun query_mud_port()
      was extended to return the appropriate port number.
    - MudOS-efun terminal_colour() added by Mica.
    - this_object() in destructed objects does not print a
      diagnostic anymore.
    - 'status tables' prints the number of cache hits both
      absolute and as percentage.
