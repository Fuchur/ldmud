pragma to 'reserve' [s]efun names
  For example, the following code compiles fine,
    void go() {
      int member;
      member = member(map, 1);
      ...
    }
  Whereas this will not,
    #pragma reserve_efun_names
    void go() {
      int member;
      ...
    }
  This obviously should not affect overloading [s]efuns.  This is also
  limited to compile time only.
