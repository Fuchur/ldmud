Well, not really. The whole idea behind that was perfomance and saved
memory. Currently, I use arrays with two (or three) members a LOT.  
I'm not that happy with the fact that the arrays use about twice as
much memory as I'd need to store the two items for themselves. Just a
memory issue. 


Maybe a more efficient storage method for arrays would help?
