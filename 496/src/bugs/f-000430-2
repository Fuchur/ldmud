There is a another small fix that I"m not sure if you
have done yet. When declaring function proto-types if
you rename the variable in the actual function
definition's variable list, eg:

     string str   to   string msg

You would have to change the proto-type's argument
name to 'msg' as well. It would be nice to just
declare the types of the arguments in proto-types:

     void SetValue( object, string, mixed );

     void SetValue( object ob, string str, mixed v )
     {
         ...
     }
