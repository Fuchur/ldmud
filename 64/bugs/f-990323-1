Short: Better handling of reset and swap

It would be advantageous if the head _and_ the tail of the object list
are marked. This would allow look_objects_for_swap() (which then again
includes the reset handling) to move forward from the head as far as it
can in one heart_beat, and then splice the processed head to the end
of the list, making the current position the new head. The 'reset table'
would no longer be necessary.

Maybe this is even easier when the objlist is a real ring.
