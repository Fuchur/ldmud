Short: Save loadable dump
From: Gawain

Type: Feature
State: New

On a regular shutdown, or with an efun, save a binary dump of all objects which can be reloaded on startup.  E.g. for soft driver updates.

All pointers etc would have to be replaced by indices.

Maybe new object flag, settable: O_DUMPABLE
For interactives and the master: prepare_for_dump(), reloaded_from_dump().
