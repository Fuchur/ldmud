SYNOPSIS
	int clonep()
	int clonep (object obj)
	int clonep (string obj)

DESCRIPTION
	The efun returns 1 if <obj> is a clone, and 0 if it is not.
        The <obj> can be given as the object itself, or by its name.
        If <obj> is omitted, the current object is tested.
        
	Objects with a replaced program count as clones.

EXAMPLE
	object o;
	o = clone_object("/std/thing");
	write(clonep(o));                           --> writes "1"
        write(clonep("/std/thing"))                 --> writes "0"
