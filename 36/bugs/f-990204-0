- pre_/post_create - Hooks  
  The former one could be used to intialize an object prior to the 
  call of create(), without haaving to abuse this __INIT-thing
  in the current implemntation. The latter could be used to check
  if people have set certain important variables in the create - esp.
  if combined with the deep_call_other above - eg. you could place in
  the item-post_create:
  if (!query_name() && 
      (function_exists("query_name",this_object()) != "/i/item/name.c"))
       raise_error("You need to set a name in the create-function !");
