Heaven7  --  <URL:http://users.hunterlink.net.au/~demrh/heaven7/>

Last tested: v 3.1.1 'Redemption' on LDMud-3.2.9-dev.255

The main problem with the mudlib are inconsistent function definitions. The
supplied patches are sufficient to allow players to create a character and log
in; additional corrections for all the areas might be necessary.

The driver changes mentioned in the release notes are not necessary for
LDMud - just configure it with the provided settings/heaven7 file.
