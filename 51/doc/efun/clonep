SYNOPSIS
	string clonep(object obj)

DESCRIPTION
	If <obj> is a clone, the name of the blueprint is returned. Otherwise
	the result is 0.

	The returned name is the filename of the blueprint at the time the <obj>
	was cloned. If the blueprint changes its name through the use of
        rename_object(), the name returned by clonep() is still the old one.

EXAMPLE
	object o;
	o = clone_object("/std/thing");
	write(clonep(o));                   --> writes "/std/thing"
	write(find_object("/std/thing"));   --> writes "0"

SEE ALSO
	clone_object(E)
