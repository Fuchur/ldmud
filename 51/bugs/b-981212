Subject: an idea about ldmud

hi,
I downloaded ldmud couple of hours ago, and started using it.
I noticed that the multiport support is already there, this is fine.
hmm, but, how can i say... is it possible to change/patch the driver so
that we can define individual access lists for each port?
here, in my university, students do not have permission to log into the
mud using some specific labratories. I have fingerd-like thing running on
port 79, i want them to be able to use finger in those labratories at
least.
this is just an example of course. i can patch the driver to have that.
but i still need that flexibility for some other purposes.
If you have time, and like the idea of course...
Thanks in advance

sorry to bother you again, but i want to ask a question.
I was using xerq-1.4 with amylaar driver
I noticed that I cannot recompile it by giving the ldmud directory path,
so I used the precompiled binary.
But it crashes more frequent than before. 
Is it possible for you to put "adding socket functions to erq daemon" into
your to-do list?
We really need it.
Thank you.
