m[x,y] has different meanings depending on m being single- or
multi-valued (think 'sequence-operator'). It would be better if
multi-valued mappings are indexed as m[x;y] which would sort of match
how the literals are written.

Making m[x][y] be equivalent to m[x;y] is useful to be compatible
to MudOS, but just there.

Maybe introduce a special 'MudOS' compat mode in the long run?
