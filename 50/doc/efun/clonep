SYNOPSIS
    string clonep(object obj)

DESCRIPTION
    If <obj> is a clone, the name of the blueprint is returned. Otherwise
    the result is 0.

    The returned name is the filename of the blueprint at the time the <obj>
    was cloned. If the blueprint changed its name in the meantime, which
    is the case for all virtual objects for example, this filename may have
    nothing in common with the blueprints object name.

EXAMPLE
    object o;
    o = clone_object("/std/thing");
    write(clonep(o));                   --> writes "/std/thing"
    write(find_object("/std/thing"));   --> writes "0"

    // Assume that all /p/virtual/*** objects are in fact
    //   cloned from /p/master/***
    o = clone_object("/p/virtual/foo");
    write(clonep(o));                   --> writes "/p/master/foo"

BUG
    The handling of virtual object clones might be considered a bug.
