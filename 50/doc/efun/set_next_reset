SYNOPSIS
    int set_next_reset (int delay)

DESCRIPTION
    Instruct the gamedriver to reset this object not earlier than
    in <delay> seconds. If a negative value is given as delay, the object
    will never reset (useful for blueprints).

    Result is the former delay to the objects next reset (which can be
    negative if the reset was overdue).

    Note that the actual time the reset occurs depends on when
    the object will be used after the given time delay, and on the
    granularity with which the driver checks for resettable objects
    (typically every 3..5 minutes).

EXAMPLE
    set_next_reset(15*60); // Next reset in 15 Minutes or later
