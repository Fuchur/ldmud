This file lists all changes to the game driver which have a visible
impact on its behaviour both towards the mudlib as well as towards
the host system.

For a detailed list of all changes see the file CHANGELOG.

20-Nov-1998 (Lars Duening) -- upcoming Release 3.2.5
    - Collapsing of '/' in object names also used for inherits.
    - Bugfix: branches in bigger lambda() closures use the correct
        branch offsets. I am not completely sure if the bugfix is
        correct, so I left in two 'DEBUG:' diagnostics with information
        needed to debug the code further if necessary.
    - Bugfix: the commandline parser printed a faulty error message
        if a required value was missing.
    - Bugfix: mapping_contains() freed the wrong values, clobbering
        passed mapping literals.
    - Bugfix: After an UDP packet was processed, the evaluation costs
        are restored (provided by Tucita).
    - Bugfix: The LPC compiler now accepts only regular files for includes.
    - Default limit for bitstrings is 6144 bits.
    - The efuns break_point() and swap() are disabled by default.
    - Pre-release versions have an extended version number of
        the form '3.2.5-dev.16'.
    - Compat mode drivers define __COMPAT_MODE__ (meant to replace
        COMPAT_FLAG eventually); native mode drivers define
        __NATIVE_MODE__.
        Similar, a driver using euids defines __EUIDS__.
    - New defines __ERQ_MAX_SEND__ and __ERQ_MAX_REPLY__ when the
        driver supports the ERQ. The values are the max sizes of
        the send and receive buffers (taken from x-erq by Brian Gerst).
    - MSDOS support removed (the MSDOS filesystem however is still
        supported).


24-Sep-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.4
    - Bugfix for the collapsing of '/' in object names.

21-Sep-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.3
    - Bugfix: mapping_contains() no longer returns destructed objects.
        (found by Zora).
    - New special command 'status files' to append file usage statistics
        from within the mud to the file /FILESTAT.
    - New commandline option:
        --swap-compact: reuse free space in the swapfile immediately.
      Giving this option results in smaller, but also more fragmented
      swapfiles, and the swap performance may degrade.

14-Sep-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.2
    - Version number pattern changed from 03.02.1@<patchlevel>
      to 3.2.<patchlevel>. This affects all uses of the __VERSION__
      lpc predefine.
    - Objects may be loaded/inherited with filenames containing two or
      more consecutive '/'es, these are collapsed into just one.
      However, it is not possible to find objects using the wrong
      names. (suggested by Zora)
    - The dreaded __INIT() bug is fixed (provided by mubo).
    - New commandline options:
        --options : prints all options used in compiling the driver
        --version : prints the game driver version
        --help    : prints a short help of the commandline options
        --longhelp: prints an elaborate description of the commandline
                    options
    - The commandline option handling was renovated, most options now
      exist in a short and long form. This caused slight changes in
      name and syntax for well-known options (.e.g '--gcollect_out_fd<file>'
      is now '--gcollect-out-fd <file>'). Please see doc/driver/invocation
      for further information. 

10-Jul-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.1@141-osb.16
    - Bugfix for the "*":: problem (provided by Daniel von Dincklage).
    - Added a minimal master for simple driver tests.
        
17-May-1998 (Lars Duening) -- Release 3.2.1@141-osb.14 and before
    - Small speedup for regexps through usage of a cache. Also increased
      the complexity limit for regexps.
    - Added support for BeOS.
    - Automatic garbage collections are kept at least 5 minutes
      apart. Every garbage collection is logged on stdout.
    - Variables are swapped independantly from program code.
    - Multiple login ports may be used in parallel. The
      port numbers are given on the commandline, efun query_mud_port()
      was extended to return the appropriate port number.
    - MudOS-efun terminal_colour() added by Mica.
    - this_object() in destructed objects does not print a
      diagnostic anymore.
    - 'status tables' prints the number of cache hits both
      absolute and as percentage.
