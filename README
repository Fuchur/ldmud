This is 'LDMud', a continuation of the Amylaar LPMud Gamedriver 3.1.2.

The latest stable version is available on

            standard include files to copy into your mudlib. Some of these are
            also used by the src/ files. 
  mud/    : the lp-245 mudlib, and support files for other mudlibs.

Oh, and 'LDMud' is still just a working title (I am too lazy for 'ld-lpmud'
or similar constructs).
