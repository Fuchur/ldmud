Installing LP-mud:

First do a "config.mud inet" since that is the only protocol which works.

Edit config.h and comm.h to be appropriate for your system, changing the
paths and hostname.  You also need to change the path mentioned in
restart_mud.  Note that all of the scripts assume that you have . in your
path.  Otherwise you'll have to edit them all appropriately.

If you're changing from an existing LP-mud, you'll have to change the
spelling of armour everywhere.  Running "fix_armor" should change it in the
files, and tell your which files you need to rename.  You'll also need to
change the wizards' levels.  Read doc/w/levels for more info.

You might want to fiddle with lpmud/security.h and lpmud/mudlib/room/tune.h
to your own personal taste.

Do "make parse" to make the game.  Then you should be able to just start
running with a "restart_mud&".

Connect via telnet by typing "telnet <your host> 2000" and make a new
character.  After you create him, edit the file lpmud/mudlib/players/<name>.o
and change your level to something over 10000.  You can now use the
"promote" command to make additional wizards.

You'll probably want to edit lpmud/mudlib/NEWS to reflect your site.  Same
goes for lpmud/mudlib/WIZNEWS and lpmud/mudlib/NEWSPAPER.  You might also
change lpmud/mudlib/obj/player.c to change the "This is the HMC LP-mud"
message that players get when they first connect.

If you have any problems with this distribution, please send mail to
jseidman@jarthur.claremont.edu.  In any case, please send me mail if you set
up a version of this LP-mud.  I keep a mailing list of administrators so
that I can mail out any important notices or bug fixes.  (Note that I mean
really important.  I won't fill your mailbox with junk.)  Also, I just like
to look around other LP-muds, so I'd like the addresses of them.
