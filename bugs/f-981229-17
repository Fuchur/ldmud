1) Something akin to MudOS's 'anonymous function' syntax. For an
   amylaar-style driver, this would end up looking something like:
     closure(type1 arg1, type2 arg2, ... , typen argn) { <code> }
   This allows the ability to embed code inside calls to stuff such
   as map_array and walk_mapping, without using lambda(). In these
   cases, lambda() is inefficient since the closure ends up getting
   recompiled every time that part of the code runs, not to mention
   being irritating to write and a real headache to read. (lambda()
   has its uses, but unless I'm actually building a function on the
   fly I like to keep to more normal syntax...)
