It would be nice to see some sort of precompiled binaries system for LDmud,
like on MudOS, CD, and others...obviously, auto_include strings, hooks, and
global defines make this harder, but it could be done...one day ;-)  One thing
is certain - at Ainumud we find a lot of our resource usage involves compiling
objects when the mud is rebooted.  A lot of post-reboot lag could be removed
by not having to recompile core mudlib objects every time.
