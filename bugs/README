This directory holds know bugs, patches and feature requests, one per file.

The filenames follow the pattern 'f-yymmdd' for features, 'b-yymmdd' for bugs,
and 'p-yymmdd' for contributed patches. Complete issues are moved over to
the directory ../done.

<yymmdd> is the date when the original issue was raised.
