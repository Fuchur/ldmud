varargs object *objects(object|int, closure)
  Alternative for debug_info(2, object|int).  The returned array contains
  objects from the nth object on. The second argument acts as a filter, with
  objects the closure returned 0 for filtered out.
  Possibly add a third argument, the object|int to end at.
