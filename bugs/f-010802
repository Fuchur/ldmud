Short: Allow wildcarded calls with arguments

Allow wildcarded calls with arguments, e.g. "*":foo(i).

For this, implement a new opcode ROLLOVER, which takes this stack

   mixed* results = ({ r1, r2, r3 })
   arg1
   arg2
   arg3
   arg4
   r4     <--- sp

and leaves it behind as

   mixed* results = ({ r1, r2, r3, r4 })
   arg1
   arg2
   arg3
   arg4
   arg1
   arg2
   arg3
   arg4     <--- sp

so the sequence could be

   compute arg1
   compute arg2
   compute arg3
   compute arg4
   const0
   rollover
   call fun
   rollover
   call fun
   roll over
   call fun
   ...

With modifications of course.
