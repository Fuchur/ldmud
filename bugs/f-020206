Short: Use OpenSSL or sshwrapper with the driver.

OpenSSL with option TSL could be linked to the driver and provide transparent
socket layer encryption.

Alternatively, look how sshwrap implements its stuff and integrate it into the
driver (might be simpler for starters). As client for testing you can use
openssl: 'openssl s_client -host HOSTNAME -port PORT'.

Also take a look at ssl tunnel: www.stunnel.org
