varargs mixed *get_dir(string, int, closure|int...)
  First, two additional options for the bitfield,
    Return program times
    Return the full file name
  Second, the third and additional arguments are funcall()'d with the file
  name of each file and the returned value added to that respective file's
  data.
  Assume that get_dir(path, 1) returns ({ "a.c", "b.c" }).  Furthermore,
  assume that the new options have bit numbers of 0x08, 0x10 respectively.
  Examples,
    get_dir(path, 1, 1, 0) returns ({ "a.c", 1, 0, "b.c", 1, 0 })
    get_dir(path, 1|8) returns ({ "a.c", "/std/a.c", "b.c", "/std/b.c" })
    Better examples require too much writing/reading ...
  Other possible options include file access times, and data returned in
  a mapping or alist.  Another possibility is an option to include "." and
  "..".  I like lots of options...
