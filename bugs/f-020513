Short: Permanently change the GC log filename

Add an optional flag to the garbage_collection() efun:

  void garbage_collection(string filename, int flag)

If the flag is non-zero, the filename will become the new default filename.

I did not make this change in 3.2.9 as it requires a security check in
the mudlib. It is already implemented in 3.3.209.
