This may already exist, and I may have missed it, being a novice,
but I can't find an efun that returns the number of lines in a file
without returning the contents of the file. I was looking for this
because I was trying to write a version of tail which would take
the number of lines as a numeric argument. I'm making a logging
device for RP sessions, and it's handy for someone who gets
disconnected to be able to reconnect and tail the RP session log
file to see what they missed. Right now the closest I can come to
getting the function of tail with number of lines as an argument
is to write a version of cat that takes a starting line and an
ending line.
