...in order to be able to read and write \0 bytes? Right, I forgot to
list this point. The tricky part is read_bytes(): if you want it to
return embedded 0-bytes, it must return an int*. So this means either a
special parameter combination to tell read_bytes() to switch into binary
mode, or the return type of read_bytes() is permanently changed from
string to int*. Personally, I'd prefer the latter solution, even though
it requires a simul-efun to stay compatible with existing mudlibs.
