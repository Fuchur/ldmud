Short: New efun factorize()
From: Tubmud
Type: Feature

SYNOPSIS
        varargs mapping factorize(mixed *tokens,closure f,mixed *args);

DESCRIPTION
        The simul_efuns collected here are thought to help when creating
        output that contains lists of anything (e.g. items).

        varargs mapping factorize(mixed *tokens,closure f,mixed *args);
          This function receives an array of things (strings, objects, ...),
          a closure that is applied to each of the elements of the array
          and omittable extra arguments for the closure. It returns a
          mapping which's keys are the results of the calls to the closure
          and which's values are arrays of the elements of the input that
          all gave the same result.

EXAMPLES

        return factorize(all_inventory(this_player()),#'creator);
        /* returns ([ 0: ({ obj/tools/robe#1723,obj/tools/test/stack#1265 }),
         *            "alfe": ({ players/alfe/obj/cloak#1423 }) ]).
         * This returns a mapping of all items this_player() carries and
         * factorizes them after their creator (using the efun creator()).
         */

==> Useful. Similar to Unique-Array. Call it m_unique?
