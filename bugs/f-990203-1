|, &, ^, |=, &=, ^= support for mixed* <operator> mixed*;
I know obs & users(), works already, but not the others.

For completeness sake, I think.  All of these operators are available in
the MudOS GD.  Compatibility would be good in this sense.

I imagine I could find a use for | and ^ with arrays at some point.  My
definition of what mixed* ^ mixed* should be probably differs from other
people though.  *ponder*  For clarity,

arr1 = ({ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 });
arr2 = ({ 6, 4, 3, 1, 2 });

arr1 & arr2 == ({ 4, 3, 2, 1 })
arr1 | arr2 == ({ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6 })
arr1 ^ arr2 == ({ 5, 6 })

I don't know how the order of the values would precisely end up...


This should also work with strings (interpreted as int*).
For example

  if (filename & "$,&" != "") { write ("Illegal filename"); }
