%b in (s)printf() to print integers in binary.
Possibly, %b by default does not print the leading zeros, and %+b or %.32b
could be used to designate that all bits should be printed.  Other format
specifiers, '-' and ':' would still be valid.  I would use this a lot myself.
It's so much easier for me to read a bitfield in binary than in octal, hex
or decimal representation.

Solved in 3.2.6:
funcall(<swapped variable>) crashes the GD.  Specifically, with various
uses of symbol_variable().  I'm not sure if this extends to
funcall(<swapped function>)
