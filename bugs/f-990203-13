explode("", "\n") returns ({ "" })  Snort.  This should not be so.

Erm.  I must not have checked this correctly.  I thought I tested it and it
did not work correctly.  However, after checking again I see that it does
not cause any problems.  The change was from the MudOS changelog so I can
only assume I was thinking of something else when I mentioned it.

Ahh yes, now I remember.  I was confused in that explode("", "") == ({ })
This is different than, for example, explode("", "anything") == ({ "" })

explode("", whatever) should perhaps always return ({ "" })
