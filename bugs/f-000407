I would like to see a way to configure specific CFLAGS, OPTFLAGS,
DEBUG, etc. in the Makefile via the settings file.  The test for -O4
doesn't fail on my system because gcc doesn't complain about it, even
though it's not documented.  I don't know what the actual output does
when you use -O4 (no effect or same as -O3, or better?), so I like to
specify -O3.  I'm a picky bastard sometimes. :)
