Short: New datatypes NULL and ERROR

Introduce a new value/type 'null' which is to be used for ie. destructed
objects and such. It could have a string attribute denoting how the 'null' was
created ("constant", "destructed object"). This would be an incompatible
change, as 'if (ob == 0) { ob destructed }' would no longer be valid.

Introduce a new value/type 'error' which behaves a bit like 'null', but is
returned in case of errors.
