SYNOPSIS
        #include <sys/debug_info.h>
        
        mixed debug_info(int flag, object obj)

DESCRIPTION
        Print out some driver internal debug information according
        to the setting of flag:

        DINFO_OBJECT (0): Information like heart_beat, enable_commands
        etc. of the specified object will be printed, and 0 returned.

        DINFO_MEMORY (1): Memory usage information like how many strings,
        variables, inherited files, object size etc. will be printed
        about the specified object, and 0 returned.

        DINFO_OBJLIST (2): Objects from the global object list are
        returned.  If the optional second arg is omitted, the first
        element (numbered 0) is returned. If the second arg is a
        number n, the n'th element of the object list returned. If the
        second arg is an object, it's successor in the object list is
        returned.

        DINFO_MALLOC (3): Equivalent to typing ``malloc'' at the command
        line. No second arg must be given. Returns 0.

        DINFO_STATUS (4): Equivalent to typing 'status' at the command
        line. The required second arg can be 0, "tables", "swap", or any
        other argument accepted by the 'status' command.
        Returns 1 if a valid argument was given, 0 otherwise.
