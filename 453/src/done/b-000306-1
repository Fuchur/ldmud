Short: make distclean is incomplete
Date: Tue, 29 Feb 2000 14:23:59 -0600
From: Casey Zacek <cz@800hosting.com>
Type: Bug
State: Done - fixed in 3.2.8-dev.175


The 'make distclean' target fails to remove a few files.  these are:

config.h
config.status
config.status.old (or .bak? something like that, i think its .old)
util/Makefile
util/erq/Makefile
util/xerq/Makefile

Not a big deal, but I use distclean a lot to compare various versions
of the source tree (I have about 10 of them right now).  Ah, I really
should just import the stuff into a CVS repository or something.
