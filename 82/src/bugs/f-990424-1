I'd like to be able to do a call out and have it return an ID value.  This is
an idea shamelessly ripped off from the CD driver ;-)  Essentially, you remove
the need to do find_call_out(<string-value-to-search-for>), and change it to
query_call_out(<numerical-id>) or something, which is more efficient to
use...of course, the efficiency increase depends on how you implement the
search system and the call outs to work with it.  The old string-search system
could be emulated very easily.  Just a thought - it might not even be
beneficial.

This might even be used in parallel to the old search-by-name system.
