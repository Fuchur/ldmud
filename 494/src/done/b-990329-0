Short: Apply on destructed object
From: Righ
Date: 990329
Driver: 3.2-dev.50
Type: Bug
State: Done - fixed in dev.74

The driver got a fatal "Apply on destructed object, function 'remove'" when
executing

  map_array(inv - ({0}), lambda( ({'x}), ({',, ({#'call_other, 'x, "remove" })
                                             , ({ #'?, 'x ({ #'destruct, 'x })
                                               })}) ) );

Typical case of 'this shouldn't happen'. The bug is not clearly reproducible
and doesn't seem to appear with newer drivers.
