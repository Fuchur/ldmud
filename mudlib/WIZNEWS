Lastest Wizard news 			May 22

Please don't make things that give players easy healing.  Any healing thing
should be limited to once a reset, and probably not more than a few points.
Even if it's protected by monsters, remember that after they're killed it's
unguarded!  If you are unsure whether healing is resonable, ask me first.
Remember, healing is the major thing that slows people down.  Next person
who makes too easy of a healing system will lose *major* points on the
wizlist!

Please do not use set_ep to raise the value or set_hp to lower the strength
of a monster unless there is a real reason (e.g. lots of magic, etc.) to do
so.

Everyone MUST read /RULES... or else!  You could lose your wizard privs if
you don't follow them!

You can now make doors with traps in them.  Read /doc/build/door for more
information.
