This is LP-mud, version 1.4.1-A.
Send comments, suggestions, etc. to jseidman@jarthur.claremont.edu (Drax).

Remember that wizards are NOT allowed to help (or harm) players.  Report any
complaints to Drax in the post office, or to the e-mail address above.
Please give the time of the incident and what wizards were on at the time.

Wizards!  Have you read your /WIZNEWS today?  Please do!  You should also
read /RULES... or else!

Players can now set their own descriptions!  Type "help describe" for more
information.

We're trying out new combat rules:  novices can't attack other players, nor
can other players attack novices.  Let me know if it doesn't work well.

Please note the scream is only for emergencies!  You should use shout for
general usage.  If you do not follow these rules, the wizards MAY ZAP YOU,
IMPRISON YOU, OR OTHERWISE PUNISH YOU!

If you are new to the game, try "help start".
