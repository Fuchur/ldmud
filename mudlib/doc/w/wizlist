Command: wizlist

The wizard top score list.
This is the ONLY purpose of the game: To be on the top of this list.
Of course, you have to become wizard first.

A wizard get one point for every command he has defined when it is used
by a player. It is quite easy to cheat, of course, but cheating wizards
are simply removed from the game (and the list).

When you use commands defined by your objects, you will also get points,
but this is legal for normal use.

The score decays with 1 % every reset, and is saved and restored from
file when reboot of game.
