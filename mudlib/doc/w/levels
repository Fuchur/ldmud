There are four levels of wizards: regular, senior, elder, and god.  A player
in any category above regular can promote (or demote) the people under him.
You must be a senior wizard in order to sponsor someone.

Also, your levels determine what privileges you have.  Some commands are
reserved for wizards of higher levels.  Talk to someone above you if you
think you need them.  These levels are customizable by the game
administrators.  They are contained in ../../security.h, so normal wizards
can't see them.

Regular wizards' main job is creating new stuff.  Senior wizards are
supposed to watch and help their sponsees.  Elder wizards should help with
the general running of the game, leaving gods for development or the like.
