command: any spell
argument: optional name of a player

Cast a spell. If no argument, then cast spell on current fighting opponent.

Spell		Cost (in spell points)	Damage  Required level to cast
missile			10		 1-20		 5
shock			15		 1-30		10
fireball		20		 1-40		15

You have to have enough experience points to be able to use the spells,
but then they will work 100 %.

If you cast a spell on an idle player, a fight will start.
