SPELL POINTS:  Spell points are used up as you cast spells or use the "tell"
and "shout" commands.  They regenerate with time, and some magic potions,
items, etc. may restore them faster (but normal alcohol does not).  When
using tell and shout, spell points *can* go negative, however you can't use
those commands if you have negative spell points.

Here are the costs in spell points for certain actions (see also the help
file "spell"):

missile		10
shock		15
fireball	20
tell		 5
pose		15
shout		20
