DYING:

Dying occurs when you go below 0 hit points.  When this happens you leave
your body and become a ghost.  You must then go back to the endoplasmatorium
and regenerate.  When you regenerate you will still be the same level, but
will have lost 1/4 of your experience, all of your money, and all of your
possessions.  The money and possessions will still be carried by your
corpse, which (if it hasn't been picked up by another player) will be
wherever you got killed.  When you regenerate you are automatically raised
back up to your maximum number of hit points, and you are put at the
appropriate level for the amount of experience you have.
