HIT POINTS:
This determines how strong you are.  When someone hits you, your hit points
go down.  If you go below zero, you die (see the help on dying).  Your spell
points regenerate with time.  They regenerate faster when drunk, and the
very act of drinking some potent drinks will (in addition to making you
drunk) restore some points immediately.
