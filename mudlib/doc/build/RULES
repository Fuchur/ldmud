These are the rules for a wizard.

1. You may not help other players, even if they lost points due to
   lost connection. They have to go to the post office and ask Lars,
   or use bug.

2. Never attack a player or kill him. If a player behaves badly, file
   the complaint to Drax.

3. Do not make 'deadly' traps. A player must never die because he didn't
   know what happens in the next room. If some room is very dangerous,
   make some hint (like the giant footprints beside the giant lair).

4. Never initialize the destination of an object outside your castle. If you
   make a monster that can walk out of the castle, be sure that it is a
   very nice monster.

5. Never generate messages that looks like something it isn't (good and precise
   rule :-). That is, don't try to fool the player that someone says something
   when it isn't true etc.
