There is a file obj/monster.c, that can be used to make simple
monsters. You have to clone it, and call various functions in it,
to set it up. Look at room/plane1.c to see how a wolf is created.

Also look at obj/monster.c to see how the monster can be configured.
It is best to use this predefined monster, because very little extra
memory will be used by clongin monsters.

If you want to give some funny valuable object to the monster, look
at how the dragon is created and equipped.
