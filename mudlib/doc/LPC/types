Variables can have one of four types:

int:	An integer. Normally full 32 bits signed.

status:	A boolean, either 0 or 1.

string:	A string (not pointer to string).

object: Pointer to an object.


All uninitialized variables have the value 0. The type of a variable is really
only a documentation, and has no effect at all on the program !
A pointer to a destructed object, will also have the value 0.
