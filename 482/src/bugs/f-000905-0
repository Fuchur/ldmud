Short: Graceful charmode recovery.
Date: 20000905
From: Lars
Type: Feature
State: New

If the driver requests charmode, but the client rejects it, the driver should
at least remember that the mudlib still expects it and treat the received
lines as if received byte by byte ("collated into one string").

Alternatively/Additionally allow to check the state of the socket.
