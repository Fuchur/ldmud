SYNOPSIS
        int remaining_eval_time()

DESCRIPTION
        Returns the remaining time for the current execution (the current
        command) before an 'evaluation too long' error would occur.

        It starts at a driver-given high value (__MAX_EVAL_TIME__) and
        is reduced every two seconds.

	Only available if the driver was compiled with MAX_TIME. If this
        is the case, but the driver was started with this feature turned
        off (the default), the macro __MAX_EVAL_TIME__ is unavailable,
        and this efun always returns 1.

HISTORY
	Introduced in LDMud 3.2.6.

BUGS
	The whole idea of a real-time limit on evaluations is ugly ugly
        ugly. At least it must be possible to suspend the limit
	for certain parts of code, because the real-time behaviour
	of LPC is very unpredictable. Better yet, a completely different
        approach.
