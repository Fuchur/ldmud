int|float pow(int|float, int|float)
  The ability to return an integer when possible is highly desirable.
    pow(2, 31) returns 2147483648
    pow(2, 1.5) returns 2.82843
    pow(2, 32) returns 4.29497e+09
    pow(2.5, 1.5) returns 3.95285
    pow(2.5, 1) returns 2.5

*chuckle*  I really must not have been thinking in this case.  Yes, raise
an error when the result cannot be stored in an integer--when two integers
are passed that is.  If either argument is a float the result is a float,
of course.
