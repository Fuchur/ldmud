State: Done - implemented in 3.2-dev.55.

mixed *m_values(mapping m, int index = 0)

Returns the data ({ m[..] }), resp. ({ m[..,<index>] }) for multi-value mappings.
If m is a multi-value mapping and index is < 0, the result is an array of all
mapping values. In other words:

  mkmapping(m_indices(m), m_values(m, -1)) == m

The '-1' index method was dropped in favour of unmkmapping() or 
m_all_values() (don't know yet).
