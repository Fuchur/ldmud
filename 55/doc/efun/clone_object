SYNOPSIS
	object clone_object(string name)
	object clone_object(object template)

DESCRIPTION
	Clone a new object from definition <name>, or alternatively from
	the object <template>. In both cases, the new object is given 
	an unique name and returned.
	
	The original, called blue print, used for cloning, should not be
	used in the system, only be used for cloning. The cloned objects
	contain only the data but the blue print also the function code.
	The blue print is the one without a unique number at the end of
	the object's file_name(). The clone_object() function never
	returns a blue print.
	
	Note that the pathname must be complete, which means there are no
	relative paths allowed.

EXAMPLE
	// Clone a torch
	object torch;
	torch = clone_object("/obj/torch");

	// Clone two keys
	object key1, key2;
	key1 = clone_object(load_object("/obj/key"));
	key2 = clone_object(key1);

HISTORY
	Modified in LDMud 3.2.6 to take an object as argument.
