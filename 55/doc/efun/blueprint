PRELIMINARY
SYNOPSIS
	string blueprint(object obj)

DESCRIPTION
	Return the load name of the blueprint of <obj> if <obj> is a clone,
	else the load name of <obj> itself.

	The 'load name' is the name under which the blueprint was initially
	compiled. If a blueprint changes its file_name() with rename_object(),
        the load name still remains the same.

EXAMPLE
	object o;
	o = clone_object("/std/thing");
	write(blueprint(o));  --> writes "/std/thing" in !compat mode
	                             and "std/thing"  in compat mode
HISTORY
	Introduced in LDMud 3.2.6.
