sorry to bother you again, but i want to ask a question.
I was using xerq-1.4 with amylaar driver
I noticed that I cannot recompile it by giving the ldmud directory path,
so I used the precompiled binary.
But it crashes more frequent than before. 
Is it possible for you to put "adding socket functions to erq daemon" into
your to-do list?
We really need it.
Thank you.
