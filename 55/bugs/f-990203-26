I don't know wether a clones()-efun is very useful. Especially in big
muds with lots of objects this would produce quite a substantial
amount of lag. I think a better idea would be to use debug_info to
walk through the object-list in small slices. Aiding in this would be
a program_name()-efun that returns the name of the program of a
object. (ob->prog->name) That would make it possible to detect renamed
objects, too.
