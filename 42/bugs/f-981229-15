I just compiled LDMud, and noticed there were actually few other efuns
I had hacked into Amylaar GD... Some aren't probably useful for anyone
else out there, but others might be. Although I don't want to add yet
another dozen of esoteric efuns to GD, I think it'd be good to discuss
about possible useful new additions anyway. So, here's my list:

- 3rd (optional) argument to efun308() (ie. "set_environment()"). As the mudlib
  of the mud in question sorts the inventories (putting 'similar' items
  next to each other), it needs to be able to decide where in the linked
  list to put objects to. This is done by supplying an optional argument,
  the object after which the 'moved' object is to be put. Although
  in the perfect world inventory-handling probably should be completely
  done by objects (rooms, containers), there's no built-in linked list
  datatype, and array-handling in LPC introduces significant overhead...
  Thus driver-handled inventory handling still has its uses IMO. I won't
  include code here, but it's a trivial addition and I can mail the
  changes necessary if need be.
