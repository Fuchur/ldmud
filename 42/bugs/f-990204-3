All types of servers need a socket address. This socket address can have different formats. 

    a.UNIX-sockets
      The format for a UNIX-socket is 'unix:<socket path>' or 'local:<socket path>'. The path can be an absolute path beginning with a '/'
      or a relative path to 'tnt_dir'.
      Example: 

      unix:/tcp/sockets/convers

    b.INET-sockets
      The format for a INET-socket is 'ip-address:port'. ip-address can be a hostname, an ip-address or a '*' for any ip-address. Port can
      be any valid port number or a name for a service.
      Example: 

      *:3600
      199.199.10.10:ftp
      foo.bar.com:2000
