Type: Feature
State: Done - implemented in 3.2.8-dev.153.

2) So long as we're swiping stuff from MudOS, grab the foreach()
   loop. Very handy in a lot of places. It shouldn't be too hard
   to make it handle variable mapping widths properly, at least to
   someone who can code it in the first place...

    incredibly more simple for looping over some specific known data..
    especially if the foreach() condition doesn't get totally reevaluated
    every time you run through it.  ie, foreach(x in users()) would only
    actually call the users() efun once.  But that' sprobably obvious.  Also
    handy for this is variable creation on the fly.  I don't remember if 3.2
    or 3.2.1 could do this or not...
