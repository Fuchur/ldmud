Already doable, sorta. ;-) A combination of a master call_out() and
something like if( sizeof( filter_array( users(), #'query_idle ) ) ) could
probably pull off the desired effect.

I can't imagine a mud with regular call_out()'s scheduled ever being
completely idle though...daemon objects will certainly keep things awake.
Just doing a call_out() every so often should be sufficient, I would
think...


Maybe an efun giving the time since the last action?
