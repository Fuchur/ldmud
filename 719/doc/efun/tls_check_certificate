PRELIMINARY
SYNOPSIS
        mixed *tls_check_certificate()
        mixed *tls_check_certificate(object obj);

DESCRIPTION
        tls_check_certificate() checks the certificate of the secured
        connection bound to <obj> (default is the current object).  If
        <obj> is not interactive, or if TLS is not available, an error
        is thrown.

        If <obj> doesn't have a secure connection up and running, the
        function returns 0. Otherwise, the result is an array with
        these entries:

          int [0]      : Result code: 0: The certificate is ok.
                                      1: The certificate is not ok.
                                      2: The certificate is self-signed.
          string [1]   : Subject
          int    [2..9]: Not used yet.
          string [10]  : SHA-1 Fingerprint
          string [11]  : Not used yet (reserved for MD5 Fingerprint)

BUGS
        Not supported when using GnuTLS.
